            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen I preached the following Sermons, I had no thoughts of Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. Having now

<pb facs="tcp:106284:4"/> whom I had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to <hi>preach</hi> that ſo much <hi>ſcandalized Sermon,</hi> on the <hi>firſt Sunday</hi> after Your Graces <hi>third Reception of the Sword:</hi> In which Sermon, if there had been any thing wherein I had made the leaſt <hi>diſloyal Glance,</hi> I ſhould not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs have carried it away without <hi>Animadverſion</hi> both from <hi>Your Grace,</hi> and Your Graces no leſs <hi>Loyal</hi> than <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical and Honourable Collegue.</hi>

            <p>It happened that being at <hi>Dublin</hi> in the
<pb facs="tcp:106284:8"/> month of <hi>March, Ann.

And being a Diſcourſe much ſuitable to my own Temper (I ſpeak ſtill of the Body of it) it was tolerably <hi>freſh in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi> and <hi>eaſily accommodable</hi> to ſuch particular <hi>Emergents</hi> as that day yielded. When therefore early in the morning I was raiſed by the Noiſe of Drums and Trumpets, and by my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb facs="tcp:106284:23"/> begun to underſtand, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed manner, the Buſineſs of the Day, I immediately fell to <hi>conſider</hi> what was <hi>my Duty</hi> therein; and the ſurpriſal permitted not better proviſion.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Noiſe which awakened me ſoon drew together into the City a great multitude out of the adjacent Country: And ſome of the Nobility at a diſtance having received Expreſſes in the night, were early with us, and the Town very full. I never ſaw in my life, and truſt I ſhall never ſee again, ſo vaſt a <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people</hi> in ſuch a <hi>medly of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi> They were come together on a buſineſs that required <hi>Joy,</hi> and <hi>rejoyce</hi> they did: yet their <hi>Love</hi> to their late <hi>Gracious King</hi> (whoſe Deceaſe they had heard of but the day before, ſome of them not till that day) was ſo <hi>tender,</hi> that moſt could not forbear <hi>Parentheſes of weeping:</hi> and ſome <hi>other Paſſions</hi> it was plain lay under theſe, even in the far greateſt number of the People.</p>
                  <p>I could not but obſerve the <hi>variety</hi> of the <hi>ſymptoms</hi> as I paſſed through the
<pb facs="tcp:106284:24"/> 
                     <hi>crowd,</hi> and all along as I rode; and my buſineſs was to <hi>model my Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> as neer as I could to the <hi>publick Occaſion</hi> and <hi>Temper.</hi> I think I may ſay there was not any Addition or Alteration to the Thoughts I brought out with me, (no not a Tranſition) which was not forethought when I came into the Pulpit. But I cannot deny that I was <hi>my ſelf</hi> a little <hi>tranſported</hi> into the like <hi>Tenderneſs and Fluctuation of Affection,</hi> which I ſaw in others. So that I may truly ſay, the Sermon has loſt by being writ in a more ſedate Temper, than that wherein it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered. For though there is <hi>nothing printed,</hi> but what was then <hi>ſpoke,</hi> yet I am ſure, ſome things <hi>circumſtantial eſcaped</hi> my memory; and of thoſe which did not, many were ſpoke in a <hi>brisker way,</hi> and what would be more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to moſt Loyalliſts, than this wherein they are now to be read.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Importunity</hi> of <hi>many,</hi> much affected with (the Occaſion, I ſuppoſe, rather than) the Sermon (or both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether)
<pb facs="tcp:106284:24"/> and eſpecially of the <hi>Counteſs Dowager</hi> of <hi>Inſiquin,</hi> cauſed me ſtraightway to put together my Sermon in Writing, as it was then preached; which was not then very difficult, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what I had writ before, and how freſh all the reſt was in my thoughts. By that Copy, then writ, this is printed: And I dare <hi>appeal</hi> to all thoſe <hi>Perſons</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> and of <hi>Judgment</hi> (of which there were not a few my Auditors) whether this be not the <hi>ſame Sermon,</hi> not only for <hi>Subſtance,</hi> but as to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> too, in all remarkable paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; as far at leaſt as it is poſſible for a man not reading what he ſpeaks to deliver the ſame thing twice in the ſame numerical words.</p>

                  <p>In what particular <hi>Criſis</hi> of the Jewiſh affairs, or on what occaſion this Pſalm was firſt penned, I have not found any ſo bold as peremptorily to aſcertain.

Therefore will we not fear though the Earth be moved, and though the Mountains be caſt into the midſt of the Sea. Though the Waters thereof roar and be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, though the Mountains ſhake with the ſwelling thereof.</hi> The removing of the Earth, the roaring of Sea and Waters, the ſhaking of the Mountains, and their being thrown into the midſt of the Sea, are all but lofty Poetical ways of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, deſign'd to expreſs great Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the State, the unſettling or remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Foundations of Government. All which when he had thus nobly ſung, he falls not in the other part, but ſweetly proceeds, <hi>There is a River, the ſtreams whereof make glad the City of our God, the holy places of the Tabernacles of the moſt High. Jeruſalem</hi> had not the advantage of any ſuch mighty River as are thoſe, which have made great and wealthy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Cities: But there was the Brook <hi>Kidron,</hi> which as 'tis deſcribed, above <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> Eaſtward, imparted a clear and gentle Stream for the watering of the lower City; And there were beſides the <hi>Waters of Siloah,</hi> which, augmented by a

To which ſoever of theſe two our Royal Poet alludes, either of them aptly reſembles thoſe ſecret and ſoft Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments, which at all times relieve and bear up the Spirits of the true <hi>Iſrael.</hi> They have not ever perhaps an irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Torrent of all the worldly Power, Security and Intereſts, that ſome could wiſh, running ſtrongly for them; but in their moſt forlorn circumſtances that their enemies can imagine them in, they have eaſie, ſecret and ſpiritual Comforts, in a way of humble affiance in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting themſelves and their affairs to his Gracious Conduct. And ſometimes, when God thinks good in his Providence to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for them more viſibly (as he has of old, and more lately in a glorious ſort for our eſtabliſh'd Church) the Emanations of his Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs are in no caſes more conſpicuous than in their Protection. <hi>God is in the midſt of her, ſhe ſhall not be removed; God ſhall help her, and that right early.</hi> ver. 5.

Mean while, to ſtill and aw all ſorts, he (yet again in his wonderful Character of Speech, and like the greateſt Artiſt) brings in God himſelf controling the Inhabitants of the Earth in the Text; <hi>Be ſtill, and know that I am God: I will be exalted amongst the Heathen; I will be exalted in the Earth.</hi> Words <hi>indifferently applicable,</hi> either to the <hi>Turbulent</hi> and <hi>Enemies of the Church,</hi> and of <hi>Davids Kingdom;</hi> (as if he had ſaid, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from your fruitleſs Combinations, and malicious Contrivances: <hi>Know that I am God):</hi> or to the <hi>faithful</hi> and firm <hi>Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of David,</hi> who, inclining to diffidence and fears of the worſt, might be in impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient hurries, and uncertain Counſels.

                  <p>Becauſe I cannot preſume any number of our Kings or Churches Enemies here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and beſides, for that it is an ungrateful thing, on this good day, to take the words in their worſt acceptation, I ſhall chiefly inſiſt on them as directed to the Church, and to faithful and loyal Subjects.

                  <p>Again, this ſame Argument will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade

                  <p>And laſtly, as to the <hi>Quiet of Sobriety;</hi> can any thing more powerfully perſwade us to keep our ſtation than this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the great Lord of all, in his courſe of Government of things, has here and thus placed every one of us, and eyes and heeds how we keep our poſts?

In other terms, thou haſt been <hi>very jealous for me,</hi> as thou ſayſt. <hi>Elijah,</hi> (God grants this in that he doth not deny it) but do not thou macerate and perplex thy ſelf about my Glory: leave that to me, and go thou on thy way, do thy bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; diſcharge the Commands I give thee: 'Tis my part to make Kings, thine only to anoint them I have made ſo.

And I pray you, my Brethren, remember, 'tis the ſame God that reigns in Heaven ſtill; nor is he now leſs ſolicitous of his Glory than then he was Can any of us pretend to be wiſer than the Omniſcient? He muſt know therefore how more fitly to order all things to his own Glory than do we:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106284:36"/> Can any of us pretend to be more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than the Almighty? He muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be more able to manage all to his Glory than we; and certainly he will not be unfaithful to himſelf. I pray you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, were it not a moſt unheard of Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cineſs, not to ſay Blaſphemy, ſhould any of us ſay to God, Let me a while govern in thy room, and diſpoſe of things, and ſee if I do not put them into better order for thy Glory? Now what do we leſs than this, if we are not content with Gods Methods, or go about to diſturb the courſe he puts things into? I do not diſſwade any from being concerned for the Honour of God. Far be it from me! It is a good argument of the Love of God and Virtue, when we reſent the Affronts which both meet with from the Wickedneſs of Men: And beſides it will put us upon the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our ſelves, and of as many as we can amend: But when ſuch Zeal breaks out into Diſcontent, Repining or Deſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Cauſe of God and Religion, or puts men on ſtepping beyond the bounds of their Calling, it is blamable and ſinful, and deſerves another kind of Reprimand than God gave <hi>Elijah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>particularly,</hi> this Argument will perſwade firſt the <hi>Quiet of Patience.</hi> For
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106284:37"/> being we have ſeen God ſo infinitely quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the ſupreme Superintendency over all things and perſons; being alſo we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe, he will be true to himſelf, we ought to conclude he will gain Glory to himſelf even by thoſe very things, by which we may fooliſhly imagine he forfeits or hazards his Glory. Wherefore if we will not be moſt unreaſonable, we muſt be patient.</p>
                  <p>Again, this Conſideration alſo enforces particularly the <hi>Quiet of Faith.</hi> If the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and the Alwiſe has reſolved that he <hi>will be exalted amongſt the Heathen, and in all the Earth</hi> too, you may eaſily be confident he will be ſo. A little Faith, one ſhould think, ſhould ſuffice men to believe God will be true to his own concerns, that is, to his Glory, Truth and Church.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, This no leſs enforces the <hi>Quiet of Sobriety.</hi> For what greater mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can there be conceived, when we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs to believe God thus reſolved and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent on his buſineſs, and to have put all things into the wiſeſt and beſt order, than for us to interpoſe and diſturb this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? And yet every man does diſturb that Order, who makes a ſtep out of his Calling, that is, out of the Order, Place and Degree God has put him into.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106284:37"/> Wherefore ſeeing God not only governs the World in general, but particularly directs all to the exalting of his own Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if the Glory of God be dear to us, as we profeſs it is, and if we believe that God is God, let us be quiet with a Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et both of Patience, Faith and Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>The third and laſt Argument in the Text perſwading ſtill the ſame Duty, is Gods <hi>Preſence, Patronage</hi> and everlaſting <hi>Conſtancy</hi> to his Church, celebrated here by the Pſalmiſt in the name of the Church; (for in the laſt verſe he brings in the Church ſpeaking thus) <hi>The Lord of Hoſts is with us, the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>is our Refuge,</hi> And it it is obſervable this is the great <hi>Chorus</hi> in this moſt glorious and lofty An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them. It in a ſort began the Pſalm. <hi>God is our Refuge,</hi> ver. 1. but word for word we have in ver. 7. and it cloſes all in the Text. Indeed the Conſideration of Gods Preſence with, and Protection of, his Church cannot be to much thought of, nor too often ſung by the Faithful. <hi>The Lord of Hoſts is with us; the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>is our Refuge.</hi> Oh! how ſweet is it both to Ear and Heart! He is with us not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as God, but as the Lord of Hoſts. And ſhould Hoſts fail, he is with us as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106284:38"/> too; and as may be ſupplyed from another place, as <hi>our Portion and exceeding great Reward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When poor <hi>Croeſus</hi> (not long before as much a prodigy of Wealth as then of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery) was led captive in Chains at the Command of his Conqueror <hi>Cyrus,</hi> into whoſe hands he had fallen by the Fraud of <hi>Apollo</hi> (otherwiſe to be called the Devil) of <hi>Delphos,</hi> whom alone above all their Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he had honoured with Gifts, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted of his Conquerour one ſmall Boon, before his Execution, which he inſtantly expected; namely, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that <hi>ſending thoſe Chains then as a Preſent, he might ask that Grecian God,</hi>

                     <hi>Whether it were his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage to put Cheats upon Benefactors his Worſhippers.</hi> This was a Reproach indeed moſt juſtly due to the Father of Lyes: But the Worſhippers of the God of the <hi>God of Jacob</hi> can never lay ſuch Imputation upon him. <hi>Our Fathers truſted in thee, they truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and thou didſt deliver them. They cryed unto thee and were delivered, they truſted in thee and were not confounded. For thou art holy, O thou that inhabiteſt the Praiſes of</hi> Iſrael! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3, 4, 5. And he, the ſame God, hath ſaid, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> Wherefore let this
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106284:38"/> Conſideration alſo induce ſuch <hi>Stillneſs</hi> and <hi>holy Quiet</hi> as has now ſeveral times been preſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Particularly</hi> again, this Conſideration alſo moſt reaſonably may induce the <hi>Quiet of Patience:</hi> For whoſe Will ought we to pay more abſolute Deference to, than to the Will of our moſt faithful Protector, our ſure Refuge and eternal Portion?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Quiet of Faith:</hi> For who fitter to be relyed upon than he who never deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a cordial Confident?</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Quiet of Sobriety:</hi> For if by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding our Calling, or going out of our place we come into miſery, it is not ſo much God that has brought it upon us, as we that have run our ſelves into it. We might have been ſafe, if we had kept within the Boundaries God ſet us.</p>
                  <p>I have now done with my Text; at leaſt in the <hi>Acceptation</hi> or Reference I <hi>choſe to take</hi> it in. I know not what remains, except any ſhould expect that I ſhould touch upon it in that <hi>other Reference</hi> I ſaid it might admit; namely, as <hi>applicable to the Enemies</hi> of the Church. For to them alſo God may be conceived with great reaſon here to ſpeak; <hi>Be you ſtill, and know that I am God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And there are not a few, were they

God forgive them, and in theſe hopes God deceive them! In the mean while <hi>let them know the Lord is God.</hi> And as we have made it our buſineſs to conſider and ſtudy our Duty, ſo by Gods Grace we will perform it. We will be <hi>ſtill,</hi> that is, patient and hopeful, ſober and loyal: and we do not doubt, but the <hi>Lord of Hoſts will be with us, and the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>will be ſtill our Refuge.</hi> We can with the aſſurance of good Conſcience take up the words of that holy King <hi>Ahijah,</hi> animating himſelf and his People in a more difficult condition than, God be bleſſed, ours is, or, we hope, is like to be; 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> xiii. 10. <hi>As for us the Lord is our God, and we have not forſaken him:</hi> We <hi>have retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and do <hi>retain his Faith</hi> and <hi>Worſhip pure</hi> as <hi>once delivered to the Saints.</hi> We have endeavoured, and in humble ſincerity we can ſay we do endeavour to perform the Conditions of his promiſed Preſence and

                  <p>Further, beſides our <hi>Gods Promiſes,</hi> we have our <hi>Kings Promiſes</hi> too for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of our Minds: and ſome men muſt pardon us, if we give a thouſand times more credit to <hi>His Majeſties Royal Word</hi> than to their <hi>airy Hopes or ventoſe Brava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does.</hi> We do not believe His Majeſty will eſteem their vain Inſultings over their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Subjects any part of Loyalty or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to him.

                  <p>But to conclude, in a word to all; lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide our private Humours and little mutual Piques at Perſons and Parties too, if poſſible, let us all joyn in a <hi>Quiet of Peace and Chriſtian Charity,</hi> which I toucht not till now, reſolving to cloſe with it.

                  </p>
                  <p>To proceed: Such Prayers as theſe muſt be <hi>made for all men.

                  <p>I will ſpeak a few things briefly of the firſt, as a good and proper foundation (for it hath ſeemed ſuch to the Holy Ghoſt in the Text) as a proper foundation, I ſay, to the ſecond. We are in our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers to make Supplications, Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Thankſgivings for all men. And I have already ſuggeſted the indefenſible ground or foundation hereof. Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity teaches and induces univerſal Charity, or Love to all men; to Aliens and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (we know) as well as to Fellow-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Friends.

                     <hi>Obj.</hi> As to what they bring in proof hereof, that the Apoſtle has given us a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> v. 16.) <hi>There is a Sin unto Death; I do not ſay that ye ſhall pray for it,</hi> that is, as appears by the Context, for them who commit it; I allow it <note place="margin">Sol.</note> to be true (and God forbid but all men ſhould allow it as ſuch, for 'tis expreſs Scripture); but I aſſert it to be in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of the Church <hi>generally unapplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as a rule of Practice.</hi> For</p>
                  <p n="1">1, What is a Sin unto Death <hi>(pro hic &amp; nunc)</hi> we know not, I mean in this or that mans ordinary practice, we are not able, (I am ſure I have not met with that judicious perſon living who has dared) to determine. If God would be ſevere, or but exactly juſt, if, as the Prophet ſpeaks, he ſhould lay <hi>Judgment to the Line, and Righteouſneſs to the Plummet,</hi> there is no Sin at all which would not be unto death: but now that through Chriſt Jeſus <hi>all who believe are juſtified from all things from which they could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>(Act.</hi> xxii. 39.) we know no Sins un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, that is, unto Death, but either (1.) <hi>Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (which if we know what it is, we cannot, I think, judge properly incident into the preſent age; if we do not know, though
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106284:47"/> we ſhould hear a man to commit it, we could not be aſſured he in that ſinned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death); or (2.) Such Sins which are an <hi>utter defeiſance of the Covenant of Grace,</hi> of which kind, as far as I am able to ſee, we know none, but <hi>final <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Impenitence;</hi> and till men are dead in their unbelief and impenitence we are not ſure (though we may ſtrongly fear) that God will not give them Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that is, we are not ſure their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief or Impenitence will be final, that is, we know not that they have yet ſinned unto Death: Wherefore if they are ſo bad that we can pray for nothing elſe in their behalf, yet may we moſt charitably pray that God would give them Faith and Repentance, though they come in even in the end of the eleventh hour of the day.</p>
                  <p>There was indeed in the miraculous days a miraculous Gift of <hi>diſcerning of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;</hi> and I will not ſay, but St. <hi>John</hi> and other like inſpired perſons might be able hereby to perceive what men ſinned unto death, and when, how, and in what acts: But I think there is none, but mad men, will in the preſent age pretend to this Gift, and then there will be no knowing who will ſin unto death, that is, be finally
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106284:48"/> incredulous or impenitent, except God ſhould reveal it to us. Beſides, as juſt now intimated, none can be ſaid to be incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous or impenitent finally, that is, to their end, till their end, that is till their death: and we do not teach to pray for any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons longer. Wherefore it remains, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God ſhould reveal to any of us that ſuch and ſuch particular perſons were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible, and by him eternally rejected from all Grace, and ſo by immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, or voice from Heaven, interdict us to pray for them, I conceive in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="2">2. If that Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which our Lord has declared <hi>(Matt.</hi> xii. 31, 32.) <hi>ſhall not be forgiven unto men, either in this world, or that which is to come,</hi> were, as in all probability it was, the Jews malicious aſcribing thoſe Miracles to <hi>Beelzebub the Prince of Devils,</hi> which in their Conſciences they were convinced he did by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, then by reaſon of the Ceſſation of Miracles no man of the preſent age is capable of it;

                  <p>In a word, as the world goes, I know not how there is any maintaining Charity or the true Chriſtian Temper, without ſtrict obſerving the Apoſtles injunction in my Text. For allow this, that we are not to pray for thoſe who have ſinned a ſin unto death, and withal that ſins unto death are in the preſent age as certainly to be known, as they are commonly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, there will be few men, if they have but ill nature enough to maintain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, whoſe Malice will not byaſs their Judgments to pronounce their Enemies to have ſinned a ſin unto death, and ſo there will be no loving of Enemies, or praying for them; at leaſt, there will be a proper method to abſolve us from the Obligation of that our Lords Command of loving our Enemies, and bleſſing thoſe that curſe us, ſo proper to the Religion by him inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, by the way, give me leave from hence to recommend unto you the <hi>Prudence, Piety and Integrity of the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of our Church,</hi> and conſequently the <hi>Soundneſs of the Reformation it ſelf.</hi> The <hi>firſt thing</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>gives in charge</hi> here

And theſe, according to the Apoſtle, <hi>were to be made</hi> for all men, and, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> tells us, were actually ſo made.

For hereby, let the King have been what he could be to them, they are convicted by our Apoſtles Doctrine, to have renounced their Chriſtianity in this caſe, with their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106284:50"/> Allegiance and Duty to their King: let them dye what they would, they dyed no Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>It is not impoſſible there are others in the world, who, though to ſave not only their Lives, but their Eſtates, they will, and do pray for the King, yet do it not either out of <hi>good Affection,</hi> or <hi>Conſcience of their Chriſtian Duty.</hi> Wherefore give me leave here, beſides the meer Evidence of the Text, to add ſome other, that the Duty we hence learn may appear to be of no ſuch indifferent or inferiour rank, as that men may omit or forbear it with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to their Integrity and good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And though I know my Audience too well to judge them of this kind, yet will not this be an unprofitable labour: for certainly none of us can have too deep or quick a ſenſe of any point of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Duty.</p>
                  <p>Now in the entrance on this Evidence, I will ſay in general, we have <hi>all the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> to this Duty, that we <hi>can have to any Duty</hi> in the World. Beſides the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from <hi>human Laws,</hi> which I will not yet touch on, we have all obligation I can conceive poſſible,</p>
                  <list>

                     <item>3. From Equity and good Nature.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>From <hi>Scripture or common Chriſtianity:</hi> The ſum of the Obligations we can have thence can well amount no higher than <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Commands</hi> (and them urged with the greateſt inſtance) and <hi>conſtant Practice or Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to Command. Nothing can be, as already ſaid, more expreſs, nothing more emphatical than the Text, of which one thing remains that I have not yet noted; namely, how the Apoſtle in the progreſs of his Diſcourſe preſſes this Practice with ſundry Arguments, and the greateſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, <hi>That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty;</hi> ver. 2. Here he preſſes it from the Fruits of this Practice; <hi>This good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour;</hi> ver. 3. Here from the Will of God, <hi>who would have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the Truth;</hi> ver. 4. Here from the Divine Nature or Philanthropy and Goodneſs of God, which we ought to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate: and <hi>ver.</hi> 8. he concludes the Subject; <hi>I will therefore that men pray every where;</hi> namely, in the kinds and ways before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
                  <p>Again, I ſay, nothing can eaſily be more
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106284:51"/> emphatical. But we may look much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther back, <hi>Eccles.</hi> x. 20. <hi>Curſe not the King, no not in thine heart.</hi> If negative Precepts, as Divines tell us, include the oppoſite af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, this will be a Command to pray for Kings in our Souls, as well as in our words, and in ſecret as well as in our Churches. However 'tis well worthy our notice, what ſenſe the <hi>Jewiſh Doctors</hi> had of this Precept, who tell us generally, that throughout their whole Law, Thoughts are no were forbidden, nor can Sin be committed by them meerly, except in the preſent caſe, and in that other of worſhipping falſe Gods: And purſuant hereto, which is very wonderful, was their general practice, yea even towards the Heathen Emperors; When they choſe all of the rather to dye, than place <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s Statue in their Temple, they at the ſame time profeſſed, that they daily offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sacrifice to the true God in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for him. <hi>Joſeph. de Bello Judaic. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9. On ſuch Practice, now a long time received in the Jewiſh Church, before Chriſt, was it that the Apoſtles here ſo earneſtly gives this in charge to <hi>Timothy.</hi> We have ſeen thus the <hi>Chriſtian Law o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:106284:52"/>
                  <p> Now as to Chriſtian Example. There can be no doubt but that the Apoſtles Practice was agreeable to their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. And as for the ſucceeding ages of the Chriſtian Church, one paſſage of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> has been produced already, and to wave that multitude of other Teſtimonies, and ſome of the very Forms of Prayer, which might be produced in this caſe, we will content our ſelves with that known and moſt full one (of undoubted authority) in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who wrote about 200 years after Chriſt; <hi>Thither</hi> (that is to Heaven) ſaith he, <hi>we Chriſtians looking up, with hands or arms ſtretched open, becauſe innocent; with heads and faces uncovered, becauſe we bluſh not; without any inſtigator, becauſe from our hearts, we pray for all Emperors, beſeeching to them a long Life, a ſecure Reign, a ſafe Family, valiant Armies, a faithful Senate, a loyal Commonalty, and a peaceable World, and whatſoever are the wiſhes of men, or of the</hi> Ceſars <hi>themſelves.</hi> This was he able then moſt truly to plead in apology for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: and at that time, and for above an hundred years after, ſuch a thing as a Chriſtian King was not known. When the Emperors became Chriſtian, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but conclude it was much more ſo.</p>
                  <p>In ſum then, as to Obligation from
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106284:52"/> Scripture, and the common Chiſtianity, if either expreſs or importunate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or conſtant Practice of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church (which is the ſum of what Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations we can have thence) will make it an indiſpenſible Duty, to pray for Kings, we have both.</p>
                  <p>Now as to Obligations from <hi>Reaſon and Prudence;</hi> perhaps that of our own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, the <hi>Benefit</hi> which hence amounts, to the <hi>publick,</hi> and ſo to all <hi>private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> of whom the publick body is made up, may be looked upon as the moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual reaſon, or beſt prudential ground aſſignable. Intereſt commonly fails not to more; let it then prevail here. Let it therefore be conſidered;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Kings</hi> and Governours are the <hi>Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of the People,</hi> the great Security of the publick Weal.

                  <p>But further, where we may look for the greater, much more for the leſs.

                  <p>In both, it may be truly ſaid of all good Kings and Princes concerned in either, or bleſſed with both, <hi>Vos, non vobis,</hi> it is not for themſelves they labour or ſucceed; the great Benefit ſtill redounds to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or to publick bodies.</p>
                  <p>As on the <hi>contrary,</hi> ſecondly. If in their Counſels or Enterpriſes Kings miſcarry, the ill Succeſs uſually falls heavy on the multitude. Though the Prince be but one man, and have but one Life to loſe, yet be ſure he can never fall alone. Nay
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106284:55"/> when the Providence of God, whoſe pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar care Kings are, in the midſt of many publick calamities, preſerves their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſafe and untouched, very often, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording the methods and ancient proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his ſovereign Wiſdom, great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the people fall. <hi>Zech.</hi> x. 3. <hi>Mine anger was kindled againſt the Shepherds, and I puniſhed the Goats.</hi> We knnow it was no otherwiſe in the tranſgreſſion of that holy King, <hi>the man after Gods own heart:</hi> David <hi>numbred the people,</hi> but the people who were numbred ſuffered. In which kind of caſes there is more ſtrict Juſtice in God, than all men generally are aware of. For that the <hi>Princes Sins,</hi> for which God at any time immediately or proximately takes puniſhment, are uſually the <hi>Effect of ſome other Sins of the People;</hi> as in the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Davids</hi> Sin mentioned 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiv. 1. <hi>The anger of the Lord was kindled againſt</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and he moved</hi> [that is, as appears by the narrative hereof (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxi. 1.) <hi>he ſuffered Satan, who ſtood up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to provoke or move]</hi> David <hi>to number</hi> Iſrael. <hi>Davids</hi> Sin was the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Peoples Sin, and ſo the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple moſt juſtly ſuffered for it. A like caſe we have, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> xxiv. laſt. <hi>Through the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Lord it came to paſs in</hi> Jeruſalem
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106284:56"/> 
                     <hi>and</hi> Judah, <hi>until he had caſt them out from his preſence, that</hi> Zedekiah <hi>rebelled againſt the King of</hi> Babylon. King <hi>Zedekiahs</hi> breaking Covenant with <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> was his own Sin, yet he fell into it by Gods being provoked with his Peoples Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and ſo it juſtly operated to the caſting them out of Gods preſence, that is, out of the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> And I muſt here boldly, but truly, ſay; whatſoever there is, that in our judgment is amiſs in our Gracious King His preſent Majeſty, is the Effect of the Sins of a great multitude of his people, either now living, or in the memory of many of us dead. If our King be not fully of our Religion, who were they, that when they had by rebellious Arms firſt depoſed, then murdered the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, afterwards drove the whole Royal Progeny into ſtrange Countries, where they found more kindneſs from them of a foreign Religion, than from the body of their native Subjects? God divert from the three Nations the Plagues yet due to that Rebellion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and its conſequent Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies! In the mean while let the preſent conſideration, how Princes miſcarriages light heavy, and that moſt juſtly, on their Subjects, as well as on the contrary their prudent and pious Conduct ſo vaſtly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106284:56"/> both the ſpiritual and temporal Proſperity of their people; let, I ſay, this moſt reaſonable conſideration move all of us to be duly devout in offering Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Prayers and Interceſſions for our King, and all ſent by him. Thoſe great <hi>Rationaliſts</hi> who ſcarce will admit any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> allow <hi>Self-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to be ſuch. I ſay, even this obliges us to pray for Kings, and that moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently; 'tis an act in our own defence, and for our own advantage.</p>
                  <p>But I truſt we are moſt of us acted by more generous Principles: let me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore propound ſuch alſo. I ſay then laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we are obliged in charity and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to this Duty.</p>
                  <p>And truly there is ſomething of this in what I ſaid but juſt now. Who will not think himſelf bound to pity, and as long as he lives pray for thoſe, whom his own Sins have provoked God to ſuffer to fall into Sin? But to wave any ſuch conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: put the caſe, Kings were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced ſo far above the race of Mankind, that they could not either through human frailty, or Gods vengeance on their peoples Sins, fall themſelves into any ſin, or do any thing amiſs; yet are they not thereby ſuppoſed impoſſible, or uncapable of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106284:57"/> their proper miſeries. And who knows not that all <hi>Crowns</hi> have their <hi>Weight,</hi> and I may ſay <hi>their Thorns too?</hi> Pardon that expreſſion, who knows not? I muſt recall it: Indeed, none know the preſſures of Crowns, but thoſe who wear them. The infelicities of being in power (eſpecially in the higheſt place of power) are greater than can be eaſily accounted: To make a good man great, is but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire or neceſſitate him to be miſerable for the publick Good: to ſay nothing of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual cares, waking nights, and thoughts (which the hearing of Chronicles read will not always divert) of the moſt poynant ſenſe of publick Straits, national Affronts and a thouſand things that will not enter into my head; this one miſery is enough to make any earthly Throne eternally unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that upon the poor Prince ever was and will be charged all publick Evils: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his male-adminiſtration, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Perſonal guilt, is ſtill cryed out of though he in the mean time be never ſo wiſe, vigilant, virtuous or innocent Thus (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxx 6) the <hi>Amalekites</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>Ziklag,</hi> and <hi>carry the Women away captive,</hi> and the people inſtead of reſcuing them <hi>talk of ſtoning David.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like miſeries whoſo conſider, will ſurely
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106284:57"/> never think he can pray too often for his King.</p>
                  <p>I might ſpeak of <hi>Obligations</hi> from <hi>humane Laws:</hi> for humane Laws to this effect have there ever been, not only in Chriſtian, but in Jewiſh and even in Heathen Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: Thus <hi>Darius,</hi> when he ordered a kind of Endowment of the Jewiſh Temple, required that the <hi>Prieſts ſhould offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of ſweet Savours unto the God of Heaven, and pray for the Life of the King &amp; his Sons.</hi> Ezr. vi. 9, 10. And it may be collected by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Reaſon, from 1 <hi>Macc.</hi> xii. 11. as well as more expreſly by what is above ſaid out of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that the Jews practiſed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. The primitive Chriſtians, we have ſeen, did it without any Imperial Laws, and <hi>ſine Monitore:</hi> But what ſhould I ſpeak of ſuch Laws amongſt us? In a word, and to conclude the whole Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for this Duty. If there may be any Obligation laid upon us, which is not grounded upon <hi>Scripture, Reaſon or humane Laws;</hi> that is, upon <hi>divine, moral</hi> or <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Principles</hi> of <hi>Juſtice, Charity and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> (all which, it is plain, we have in the preſent caſe); then I ſhall confeſs, there is ſome Obligation wanting, which might have been laid upon us, to be aſſiduous or
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106284:58"/> inſtant in Prayer for our King. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if even new Grounds of Duties could be aſſigned, and humane Nature and Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety ſhould come hereafter to be regulated according to other meaſures than the World has hitherto known, yet theſe will be obligatory ſtill: Therefore I muſt ſay after the Apoſtle, <hi>I exhort that Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Prayers, Interceſſions and giving of Thanks be made for all men: For Kings, and them that are in Authority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when I have in a very few words preſs'd the Practice of what I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been demonſtrating to be our Duty, I ſhall conclude.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, in the name of God let none of us, in what capacity ſoever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther private or publick perſons, be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Duty. Be we what we will, we are or would be looked upon as Chriſtians, or Friends to humane Society. We are not ſuch, as plead for mens living wild and ſavage upon the face of the Earth. If we be not ſuch, we are then concerned and held faſt in the Tyes before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Wherefore,</p>
                  <p>In thoſe <hi>publick Prayers</hi> which the Church has provided for us, and moſt Chriſtianly, according to the Apoſtolical
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106284:58"/> Injunction and primitive Pattern put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our mouths, let us be <hi>cordial and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere:</hi> let them not paſs over with us as matter of meer Form and Cuſtom, but honeſtly engage our Hearts in zealous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and fixt reſolutions of Loyalty. I have heard it has been objected againſt our Liturgy, that Prayers for the King occur therein too often, that there is in this behalf a great deal of vain Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a Fault taxed by our Lord in the Prayers of Heathens. It were an eaſie thing to vindicate our Service-Book from Tautology, even in this regard, were there now either Time or Need. In a word, there never comes two Prayers for the King in the ſame Office, of the ſame kind, or to the ſame purpoſe. And it is to be remembred, diverſe kinds of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are commanded; <hi>Supplications, Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Interceſſions and giving of Thanks are to be made for all men: For Kings, and them in Authority.</hi> Or if there were any ſuch, yet new Affections ſtill added to Prayers coming over again, at ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, will as much make them new Prayers, as our Lords greater Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Garden made the Prayer which he uttered <hi>the third time, in the ſame words,</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:106284:59"/> no vain Repetition. If we have any ſparks of Reaſon in us, let us be aſhamed of ſuch pretences. We will tell the world, that what ſome ſcrupulous perſons thus plead againſt our Liturgy, that it too frequently applies to God in behalf of the King, will ever, we hope, operate to the maintaining it. What theſe account its Fault, may be its and ours, and, if they will be of one piece with us, their Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. In the Name of GOD therefore let us devoutly hold to it: It will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove Us and our Religion to God and Men.</p>
                  <p>And again. <hi>In private,</hi> let us imitate the Primitive Chriſtians; of our own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and <hi>without any Remembrancer,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending our King, his Perſon, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Family, and Affairs (for ſo we have ſeen they did) to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and Guidance of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>If after all I have ſaid, I thought any thing wanting to preſs this Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I could add, what me thinks would put every one of us on our knees in this behalf as frequently before God as might be deſired; namely, that we can take no more effectual courſe than this, to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106284:59"/> ſecure the Government of our King to be according to the Will of God: A thing we pretend ſo much to deſire! <hi>Prov.</hi> xxi. 1. <hi>The Heart of the King is in the Hand of the Lord: as the Rivers of Waters; he turneth it whitherſoever he will.</hi> If we were all to have our wiſhes in the behalf of the Kingdoms, there could no greater Bleſſing befall us, than to have our King a perſon <hi>after Gods own Heart.</hi> There is no way in the world to make him ſo, like our ardent and conſtant Prayers to God for him. Surely a King of ſo many Prayers cannot miſcarry.</p>
                  <p>I will therefore conclude all with a <hi>ſecond Exhortation,</hi> and that a little more limited to this preſent Day. I am ſure there are few or none of us, who will not this Day before we ſleep, perhaps ſeveral times, be praying, or at leaſt ſay, <hi>God bleſs the King.</hi> Now, that our Prayers may be effectual this Day, I will exhort only, that we <hi>keep our ſelves</hi> all in ſuch a <hi>Temper,</hi> as to be able <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly</hi> and in a <hi>true Chriſtian Temper to pray ſo,</hi> when we go to bed. I do not forbid eating our Meat, or drinking our Drink with Gladneſs and ſingleneſs
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106284:60"/> of Heart, and wiſhing well to our King, his Subjects, and one another in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But I caution all againſt Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and Madneſs. Is it Senſe or Loyalty to be drunk for the King? Or, if the KING ſhould ſee it, would He thank or commend or think the better of any man for it? For ſhame, Good Chriſtian People, beware of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs, ſuch Barbarity. At the ſetting of <hi>David</hi> upon the Throne, <hi>on the Holy Hill of Sion,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt commands, <hi>Serve the Lord with Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and rejoyce with Trembling.</hi> Pſalm II. 11. I do not preſs ſo much as that comes to; Do but <hi>rejoyce with Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Rejoyce ſo, as not to provoke God; Rejoyce ſo, as that you may have Joy in the latter end. His Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſty, God be bleſſed, is far from approving, and all men ſay, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from conniving at Debauchery. As we cannot therefore thereby pleaſe Him; ſo it is certain, we are thereby ſure to diſpleaſe God. Let us therefore ſtudy, not only this Day, but all our Days, to maintain an holy, devout, ſerious Temper; being always fit and reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all Prayers and Supplication,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106284:60"/> with Thankſgiving, to make our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt known unto God. And the Peace of God, which paſſeth all Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhall keep our Hearts and Minds through Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>To whom, with his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Father, and the Eternal Spirit, be all Honour, Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>IN the Addreſs of the Clergy of the Dioceſs of <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Roſs (March</hi> 1684/5.) which I had the Honour to pen, there was made this ſacred Promiſe; <hi>That as our Lives were not dear to us in compariſon of our Religion and Loyalty, ſo we would not fail, though with the peril of our Lives, by the ſtricteſt ties of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (which abhors all Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:106284:63"/> 
                     <hi>or Unfaithfulneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Prince) to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour the ſecuring to His Majeſty our peoples as well as our own Loyalty and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> Purſuant to theſe Vows, I have ample proofs of my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns Sedulity generally: And as to my ſelf, as I had not been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly remiſs, ſo when about the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> following, <hi>Argiles</hi> Rebellion in <hi>Scotland</hi> alarm'd us, which (though, God be bleſſed, both ſuddenly and happily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt) was ſeconded with that of the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> in the Weſt of <hi>England, I</hi> thought it was time to ply my Duty with ingeminated Diligence, and to do my utmoſt by all Inſtance and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to confirm and keep ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb facs="tcp:106284:63"/> in their Loyalty, as far as in me lay, the whole body of my Charge. I therefore went abroad, ſeveral <hi>Sundays,</hi> to the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Congregations of my Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and in my Circuit, I preached this ſame Sermon (I confeſs) three ſeveral times; firſt in the City of <hi>Cork,</hi> then at the Town of <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale,</hi> and laſtly at the Town of <hi>Bandon;</hi> all of them very great Auditories. The iteration of it was not from Idleneſs, but becauſe I could deviſe nothing elſe more cloſe and appoſite to the conjuncture. Yet is its Subject matter ſuch, that it is not, I conceive, ſtill unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and I fear, as long as the world ſtands is not like to be. For as long as there are vices and luſts amongſt men, there will be violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:106284:64"/> of Peace in one kind or other. Now this <hi>Sermon</hi> conſiſts wholly of <hi>Counſels and Directions</hi> for ſecuring and maintaining <hi>Peace</hi> in all its <hi>ſeveral branches and kinds.</hi> It might eaſily have been dilated into a far larger bulk: but few Readers (or indeed Hearers, now adays) complain much of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity: And in the preſent caſe, I hope, it will be eſteemed no fault at all, becauſe what I have ſaid on each Point is large enough, I think, not to be obſcure, and (I hope) the whole not much more defective, than an hours Diſcourſe on ſo copious a Subject muſt needs prove.</p>

                  <p>Then as to the outward Product of ſuch inward Temper, it follows, <hi>Be courieous,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Not rendring Evil for Evil, or Railing for Railing: but contrariwiſe Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, knowing that thereunto are ye called, that ye ſhould inherit a Bleſſing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to back, or further enforce, the latter part of this Exhortation, he brings
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106284:65"/> in, as a proof of what he had laſt ſaid (namely, that peaceable and ſweet tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered men ſhould inherit a Bleſſing) two or three Verſes out of the Old Teſtament <hi>(Pſal.</hi> xxxiv. 13.) directing ſuch Life and Temper as the true way to Bleſſedneſs, part of which citation is our preſent Text, <hi>Seek Peace and enſue it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By which account thus given of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the Words, it appears, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ſeveral Chriſtian Duties which concern us in order to preſent and future Happineſs, (in order to inheriting the Bleſſing) the ſtudy of Peace is one of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal note. <hi>Seek Peace,</hi> ſay both the bleſſed Pſalmiſt, and the Apoſtle, (and in them, both <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament and <hi>New) if you would inherit the Bleſſing</hi> promiſed in either.</p>
                  <p>The Words are not obſcure, but yet emphatical; <hi>Seek Peace.</hi> If either Peace or the ways and methods to it ſhould be obſcure, or do not readily offer themſelves, make it your buſineſs by diligent and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous ſearch to find out both one and the other. And not only ſeek it, but enſue or purſue it. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The word properly imports the following hard after that which flies. As if he had ſaid, Though Peace ſhould at any time ſeem upon the wing, to be gone out of the Countrey, or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106284:66"/> out of the World, yet purſue her ſtill. Deſiſt not from your endeavours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve her, and if you ceaſe not to <hi>purſue,</hi> you ſhall infallibly reach her here or in a better world.</p>
                  <p>To this paſſage of <hi>David</hi> and of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> it were eaſie to annex divers others as expreſs to the ſame purpoſe, out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of Holy Writ. Hear our Lord himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> v 9. <hi>Bleſſed are the Peacemakers, for day ſhall be called the children of God.</hi> And if you remark it, moſt of the foregoing Beatitudes <hi>Bleſſed be the poor in ſpirit,</hi> that is, the humble and lowly minded, <hi>Bleſſed be thee meek, bleſſed the merciful, &amp;c.</hi> are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodable to the peaceable Spirit; which has a moſt intimate kindred with Meekneſs, Mercifulneſs, Humility and other like Chriſtian Graces. Again, hear the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> xii. 18. <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as in you lies</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, on your ſide, or as far as concerns you] <hi>live peaceably with all men.</hi> If any will not be at peace with you, let it be their fault, not yours. Yet again, <hi>Hebr.</hi> xii. 14. <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low peace</hi> (the ſame word as in the Text, <hi>purſue peace) with all men, and holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> But why do I ſpend time in repeating what all know, and have daily in their mouths. To be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106284:66"/> ſhort, the Commands are ſo explicit and plain, and have ſuch Promiſes annexed to them, and withal ſo often repeated (in the Old Teſtament and in the New, by our Lord himſelf, by the Apoſtle of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in the Text, by the Apoſtle of the Gentiles in the places mentioned, and by others elſewhere) that we muſt need account the Endeavour of Peace to be a Duty which the Holy Ghoſt has laid the greateſt weight upon: nor can he ſtyle himſelf a Chriſtian, who employs not this way his utmoſt power.</p>
                  <p>The reſt of my Diſcourſe therefore ſhall be taken up in recommending Directions for the more ſucceſsful Practice of this Duty. And theſe ſhall be proportionate to the ſeveral ſorts of Peace, and as neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attemperated to the preſent publick Circumſtances and Neceſſities as I can.</p>
                  <p>Now in our ſetting forth, it will be meet to remember, that <hi>Peace</hi> may be oppoſed to <hi>Diſcontent,</hi> as well as to <hi>Strife and War.</hi> Thoſe, who have inward Grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Diſſatisfactions, are as far from ſome ſort of <hi>Peace,</hi> as thoſe who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in actual or open Quarrels. And a both regards Peace is either <hi>publick, private</hi> or <hi>ſecret.</hi> And the publick Peace <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gain is either <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106284:67"/>
                  <p> Firſt then as to <hi>Publick Civil Peace.</hi> By Gods great Bleſſing we enjoy this here, while our Neighbors every where, on the other ſides of the Water, are embroiled. For ever bleſſed be our good God, who has ſingled us out as the peculiar Objects of this his Mercy at preſent, yet let <hi>us</hi> ſtudy <hi>Peace</hi> alſo, that is, endeavour to keep it. And to this purpoſe I can give no better directions than theſe following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Maintain entire and unſpotted <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty.</hi> I hope I ſhall not need much to preſs this Advice, eſpecially in this place. The Commands for Subjection and Loyalty are as expreſs in Scripture, as are theſe for Peace, but juſt now mentioned: only it would divert us too much from our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe to alledge them now. And I muſt tell you, it is the peculiar <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> that as it was made by an happy Conſent and Union of the Royal and Eccleſiaſtical Power of the Realm, ſo the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of it can never be taxed in any points either of <hi>reſiſting</hi> or <hi>deſcrting their Prince.</hi> In all the Wars ſince the Reformation, in all the Plots, old and new, not one true <hi>Church of England-man</hi> to be found all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; before any fell into ſuch deſigns, they were either leavened with Fanaticiſm,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106284:67"/> and ſecretly fallen off from the Principles and Unity of our Church, or open Apoſtates from her; elſe they were never of us. This might be proved by particulars: but ſuch proof is not for this Office, or place; only from what I have ſaid I will infer, if there ſhould be any perſon here <hi>ſtaggering in his Loyalty,</hi> much more if a Deſertor of it, though yet but ſecretly, that ſuch perſon is neither <hi>Chriſtian</hi> nor <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he pretends. He's fallen off from his Chriſtianity, which commands Subjection and loyal Adheſion: And he's as much fallen off from the eſtabliſht reformed Church, which ever taught and practiſed both Loyalty and Non-reſiſtance: witneſs our Book of Homilies and our Canons. But I will quit this head, as hoping it to be needleſs here long to be inſiſted on.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In order to keeping and maintaining the publick Peace, let every one be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in his own buſineſs, and <hi>keep</hi> within the <hi>bounds of his own Calling.</hi> This alſo is an expreſs Command in Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vii. 20. <hi>Let every one abide in the ſame Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wherein he was called.</hi> And perhaps if any one were to define the Peace we are now ſpeaking of, <hi>(viz.</hi> Publick Civil Peace) he could not give a better or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106284:68"/> plainer account of it, than by ſaying, It is the general Agreement or Concord of all ſorts of men in doing each his own buſineſs. From which foundation it muſt neceſſarily follow, that what I adviſe is one of the ſureſt methods of Peace poſſible. But I will quit the poſitive part, and on the contrary only tell you, what is a great but ſad truth, that the Pragmatical Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which is abroad, much diſturbs the Peace, at leaſt one kind of it, the Quiet of mens Minds, throughout the Country. It creates Jealouſies over us, and that too moſt juſtly in the minds of our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. What have we to do with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delling State Affairs, or enquiring into publick Councils, which yet is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Entertainment of every petty Club, nay almoſt at all other Meetings of men, except it be in Church; and 'tis well if ſome totally forbear it even here. Hear you, my Brethren! will not our own Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, common or Chriſtian (of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of both which, one day we muſt give an Account) find us work enough? If I am an Artificer or a Tradeſman, there is no doubt of it: one thing or other in my way I may find regularly to employ me. And there's encouragement for it; <hi>Prov.</hi> xxii. 29. <hi>Seeſt thou a man diligent in</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:106284:68"/> 
                     <hi>his Buſineſs, he ſhall ſtand before Kings, he ſhall not ſtand before mean men.</hi> But ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; it muſt be Diligence in his Buſineſs, in that which is own, not anothers Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If I am a Gentleman, I have an Eſtate to manage, and Servants to look after, Accounts to take: beſides I perhaps have ſome publick Truſt or Buſineſs of my Countrey. Are all theſe faithfully or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently attended and heeded? If they be, I have further a Soul of mine own, an excellent Being, to improve in Knowledge and in Virtue. Am I ſo happy in my Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or even in my natural Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that I can find no Books which I can read with advantage, no Studies Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical, Mathematical, or even Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, which I can entertain my ſelf in? I may hereby accompliſh my ſelf for the Service of my Country, or of my ſelf and Friends, be ſure of my Soul and of my God: If not theſe, there are after due Devotion and common Buſineſs done, there are, I ſay, Countrey Divertiſements which may innocently imploy ſome hours: Any thing rather than Sin, rather than do a publick Miſchief, that is, be acting out of my Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Again, if I am a Miniſter, have I not work enough? Or indeed, when I have well bethought my ſelf, have I any
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106284:69"/> leiſure? Alaſs! indeed, my work is, as my reward, if faithful; or as my puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if otherwiſe, endleſs. To conclude this Point: If we have all of us, of what ſtate or degree ſoever, full employment in the way God has put us; let us not embroil our ſelves and the World by med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with what belongs not to us, or in none of our buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>It may be thought I have forgotten here that there are not a few Men (at leaſt Abroad, or up and down in the Countrey) who have no Calling at all, who wear good Cloaths, go Gent (as ſome ſpeak) ride good Horſes, and are otherwiſe accoutred; Now how will this Direction comprehend or ſuit them? Truly not at all: Theſe hear me not, I preſume, nor have I any thing to do with ſuch Outlyers. But I conceive the Laws, which were deſigned for our publick Peace take notice of theſe People, and it is the duty of Magiſtrates and Perſons in publick Truſts to take notice of them, and ſecure them, as being matter prepared and ready dryed for publick Flames and Combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And in ſaying thus much I am ſtill but upon the ſame Point. I preſume this is part of the Magiſtrates Duty and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, whom certainly it eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106284:69"/> as they tender the publick Peace, to mind, attend, and be diligent in the buſineſs of their Calling: And perhaps this part may be as ſeaſonable at preſent as any.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As a farther means of maintaining Peace, Let us <hi>avoid the Company,</hi> at leaſt the <hi>Familiarity,</hi> of men of <hi>Turbulent Spirits.</hi> This indeed is but prudence, in regard of our own private ſafety: For we have late Inſtances enough before us, what fatal Ends the Converſation and Society of unquiet deſigning <hi>Achitophels</hi> has brought many (perhaps formerly) Vertuous Perſons to. But I do not now adviſe this caution in that regard, (though I ſay in that regard it is adviſeable, and Counſel that ought to be taken): But as a means to preſerve the publick Peace amongſt us. For let but Pragmatical or Turbulent Agitators be avoided, let them <hi>ſtand alone,</hi> and ſee the World dare not truſt them, or will have nothing to do with them, and they will either be diſcouraged or diſabled from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miſchief. <hi>They can do no hurt, as long as they are alone.</hi> And I pray you Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, eſteem this a part of your Duty, as well as Intereſt: For hear the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> iii. 6. <hi>Now we command you, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:106284:70"/> (obſerve both his Earneſtneſs and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Brethren,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>In the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we Command you) that ye withdraw your ſelves from every Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that walketh diſorderly, and not after the Tradition which ye received of us:</hi> Now can any ſingle act be more diſorderly, that is, as the Apoſtle himſelf explains his own Term, more contrary to the Tradition or Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; than for men to be undermining or unhinging Governments; deſigning againſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting Kings, engaging themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in Rebellious Wars. Did Chriſt, did the Apoſtles any where ſuch things? Or did they teach, adviſe, or encourage any ſuch practiſes, or not rather the direct contraries? Subjection, Obedience, Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, <hi>Giving Caeſar his due,</hi> as well as <hi>God his;</hi> was both their Doctrine and Practice. Give me leave to uſe a plain Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude to enforce this Point. Put the caſe it were now a very infectious conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious time (as, God be bleſſed, it is not here) let me ask you, if any one of you knew, ſuch or ſuch a particular perſon to be tainted with the Plague, or to have it upon him, would you lye in his Boſom, would you hang upon his Mouth, would you ſuffer him to breath on you, or would
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106284:70"/> you ſuck in his Breath impregnated with the Plague-Venome? Or rather, would you not deſire he might be ſent away to a Peſt-houſe, and kept from ſpreading the Contagion? At leaſt you would keep aloof from him your ſelves. My Brethren, this is the very caſe. Theſe little Caballing Politicians of the Age, have a moſt peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Infection about them, a ſeditious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, pragmatical Spirit, and 'tis very catching. They are indeed the common Plague of the three Nations; wherefore avoid them: Let them dwell alone, till Shame and Penitence ſhall make them wholſome, and ſit for humane Society.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the former Direction cannot be perfectly practiſed by any, but ſuch Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents will ſlipperily inſinuate themſelves into your Company; be ſure then, as ſoon as you know them, to diſcover both them, and whatever you know of their Projects &amp; Councils, &amp; that immediately. In the name of God let nothing of this kind ſleep with you. Let not that falſe opinion of I know not what vain honour, which has made ſome men, to their coſts, ſhy of impeaching others, betray you to conceal what may operate to your own and the publick Ruine. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, my King, my Countrey, the Church, or (if theſe be leſs dear to any)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106284:71"/> my Family and my ſelf, ought to be loved firſt, and before any particular Friend or Aſſociate. Conſult therefore chiefly the welfare of theſe; And I pray you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, <hi>concealing Treaſon</hi> is <hi>Treaſon,</hi> not only by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> but by the <hi>Old Judicial Law</hi> amongſt the Jews, which derived from <hi>God</hi> himſelf. According to this Divine Law, or [the <hi>Miſhpat Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meluchah]</hi> the Statutes of the Kingdom, a Book written by <hi>Samuel</hi> at the command of God, and ſaid to be <hi>laid up before the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> x. 25. <hi>Saul</hi> pronounces them guilty of High-Treaſon, <hi>who knew when David fled and did not ſhew it,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxii. 17. And his Sentence had undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been juſt, had either <hi>David</hi> or the Prieſts been guilty of the matter of Fact, charged reſpectively on them: Even the principles of common reaſon and juſtice, the grounds of all good Laws, will conclude as much. Wherefore we ought to look upon it as a matter againſt good Conſcience, as well as againſt Prudence and Common Law, to conceal ſuch treaſonable diſcourſes or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns as come to our knowledge.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Spread not</hi> thoſe <hi>Idle Stories</hi> or Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions which go up and down of <hi>publick Dangers.</hi> If you can in the beginning trace them to their head, to any true or proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106284:71"/> Original, ſo as to fix them on their malicious Authors, do ſo; and as before ſaid, diſcover them. Then in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; you have put an end both to the Lye and its Miſchief: You have cruſht the Cockatrice in its Egg. Otherwiſe, know they are deviſed by cunning and ill-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Men, and put into Fools Mouths to report, that the Deviſers may take their advantages of thoſe reports, either by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing their own Malice on innocent Men, or by gaining ſome plauſible pretence for the Spleen they would wreak; ſo that they may be able, when time comes, with ſome colour, to call <hi>Spite</hi> and <hi>Wrong</hi> by the names of <hi>Juſtice</hi> or <hi>Self-Defence.</hi> In <hi>Levit.</hi> xix. 16. we have a peculiar pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, which explains the ninth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment fitly to our preſent purpoſe. <hi>Thou ſhalt not go up and down as a Talebearer amongſt thy People, nor ſhalt thou ſtand againſt the Blood of thy Neighbour.</hi> To ſpread Reports and Tales is one of the moſt miſchievous kinds of bearing falſe witneſs. And there are <hi>publick Tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers</hi> as well as private ones. Truely there are ſome that ſeem to make it, not ſo much a Trade as the Buſineſs of their Lives: they catch up all the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that are going, and have their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106284:72"/> Cuſtomers both to bring them in, and to vent them too. Theſe people are ill mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers both of Church and State. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, I cannot but take notice of a Story very freſh and brisk in the Country; <hi>That the</hi> Engliſh <hi>are combining in a deſign to riſe and cut all the Throats of the</hi> Iriſh: And on the other ſide, many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are told, and believe, as much of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. What are theſe but Devices of wicked men, or of the Devil by them, to put us upon the imbruing our hands mutually in one anothers Bloud. On nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, in the preſent circumſtances of both, is the thing either <hi>probable,</hi> or ſo much as <hi>poſſible.</hi> As to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was there ever yet ſuch a thing heard of, upon the face of the Earth, as a Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre by <hi>Proteſtants?</hi> Thoſe men who know our Religion, know the Principles of our Religion will not ſuffer it. Nay further, it is not <hi>poſſible</hi> at preſent, as were eaſie to ſhew. 'Tis well if we are able to defend our ſelves. Is it not a pleaſant thing to ſee in a Pariſh between three or four hundred people ly by night out of their Houſes, for fear of two or three Families, in which there are not Seven perſons able to bear Arms? For ſhame let not people ſuffer themſelves to be thus abuſed. Then
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106284:72"/> as to the other ſide, touching the rumour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed danger of a Maſſacre upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> Is not this, at preſent, a plain, abominable Device to put us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Ears? ſet on foot by them who deſire an advantage againſt us, to the end that if by theſe affrightments they can tempt any weak perſons of us to any irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular actions, they may more juſtly ſeek occaſion of Revenge by their own hands, or otherwiſe accuſe and miſrepreſent us. I confeſs, this is out of my Province a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; but I could not forbear it. For Gods ſake, and our Countreys ſake, and our own ſake, let us all joyn together to bring to light the Authors of theſe Reports; but however let us not ſuffer our ſelves to be ſo far ridden by them, as to be their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or Beaſts of burden, to carry ſuch forged Wares up and down the Countrey.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, as another Preſervative of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace, I take it to be good Advice, that we paſs not bad Interpretations on the Acts of the Government: a fault that more people are guilty of, then I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſo much as to characterize. I pray you remember, Charity ever requires us to think the beſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiii. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Charity thinketh no evil, rejoyceth not in iniquity,</hi> (which as appears by the oppoſites, may be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106284:73"/> maketh not advantage of falſhoods) <hi>but rejoyceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things</hi> (does not readily give men up for deſperate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible) <hi>endureth all things,</hi> or grows not impatient upon every matter of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, that offers it ſelf. Some haply will ſay, this Text treats only touching the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of private Charity towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Be it ſo: but do I owe all theſe Offices of Charity to each private man, and not to the moſt conſiderable body of men which I can pick out in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, to Magiſtrates and Governours? To deal more roundly; Muſt I have Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for every particular man, yea even for Enemies, and none for my King and his Council? To be ſhort then, if we love the publick Peace, let us neither make ill conſtructions our ſelves of publick Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor ſilently admit them, when we hear them made by others. Let us at leaſt profeſs our Charity, and that we hope better, than ſome interpret, or others fear.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, and to conclude all the advice on this Head, for the poſſeſſing our own and one anothers minds with Quiet; Let tis <hi>remember,</hi> what I have formerly preſt, <hi>God rules over all.</hi> His hand is in all. And let us be content he ſhould govern. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106284:73"/> let us ſtill any riſings in our minds. Herewith let us ſilence others. 'Tis a wholeſome ſtop to put to the jealous Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Diſcourſes of thoſe who delight in ill Preſages, God governs all, God is Judge himſelf. In the mean while, let us endeavour to mold our Minds into a perfect Submiſſion to the Divine Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, ſtill truſting God, and hoping the beſt; for God be bleſſed, I ſay again, we ſee yet no other reaſon. And thus far as to Methods for preſerving the Publick Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Peace.</p>
                  <p>It may here perhaps be expected that I ſay ſomething as to the <hi>Publick Peace of the Church:</hi> God be bleſſed, alſo in this kind, we are much quieter here, than are others in other places. My meaning is, thoſe, who are not of us, at leaſt hereabouts, are not yet ſo inſolent as to diſturb us. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to ſpeak out in this caſe. I know but one effectual way to reſtore more perfect Peace to our Church here, or to preſerve what we have at preſent, and 'tis this; That thoſe who <hi>call themſelves Proteſtants</hi> would <hi>unite in Religion</hi> or <hi>publick Worſhip,</hi> and be all of one piece; I mean, that the ſeveral ſorts of Diſſenters would come in to the publick eſtabliſht Church: for mine own part, I am amazed to ſee, that any
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106284:74"/> of them who have but a fair pretence to Sobriety, ſhould in our preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſtand out. As to the Enthuſiaſtical part of them, there can be no Action of theirs which a man ought to wonder at: for be it never ſo wild, it is ſtill agreeable to the Meaſures they have taken. But that Men ſhould allow our <hi>Doctrine</hi> to be ſound, our <hi>Worſhip</hi> ſo far forth pure, that they can with good Conſcience joyn therein, our <hi>Sacraments</hi> valid, ſo as that they do and muſt derive their being Members of Chriſts viſible Church from hence, that they or their Principals were baptized in our Church, and in a word, <hi>our Church</hi> to have reformed from all groſs Corruption, and yet that they ſhould think themſelves bound in Conſcience to ſeparate from us, to ſet up themſelves againſt us, (Church againſt Church, Altar againſt Altar) to the weakening both of themſelves and us; and all this in a time when none cry out more than themſelves of publick Dangers for want of Unity: this, I muſt again pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, makes me ſtand amazed. In ſuch exigences will they allow nothing to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to publick Peace? Nothing to publick Safety? They muſt needs ſee by their own Obſtinacy they have put it out of our hands to help them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and will they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106284:74"/> notwithſtanding ſtill continue their Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? I have at other times put the Queſtion, whom, or what Church will they join with, if they ſtill remain ſeparate from us? Will they ever be <hi>Straglers,</hi> unfix'd, without Form, Government, or any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Union and Coalition? In the name of God, if nothing elſe, let what they are ſtill crying out of the publick Dangers (if they believe themſelves that there are ſuch) let, I ſay, their Senſe of the publick Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger drive them to take refuge in the Arms of their forſaken Mother, which are ever open to receive them. I will add no more. This is the only mean of any tolerable Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Peace, which I can think of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us here. And the good God <hi>unite our hearts to fear him, and love one another,</hi> and then this Counſel will ſoon take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                  <p>I am now to proceed to <hi>private Peace,</hi> and the methods probable to it. By pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Peace I mean, Peace in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and Peace in the Family. This cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ought to be purſued and ſought by all; to be reſtored if violated, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained if on foot or in preſent being. I will not ſay that ſuch private Diſcords are always or ordinarily the grounds of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Broils: but I may ſay moſt truly they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106284:75"/> prepare men for them. When men are diſcontent at home, or in the Neighbour hood, they are ready for any turbulent and deſperate Imployment, which may capacitate them to revenge themſelves, or ſerve to divert their uneaſie Condition. If there be at any time publick Diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ariſing, any perſon ſetting up new Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, Intereſts or Deſigns, then every one that is in debt, every one that is diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, every one that is in diſtreſs gathers themſelves unto ſuch or ſuch a Pretender, and <hi>he becomes a Captain over them.</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> xxii. 2. It was ſo then, and this I verily believe at preſent arms more Rebels of of the common ſort, than any thing elſe: Men exhauſt their Eſtates, neglect their Callings, run a gadding after I know not what or whom, by ſuch means become en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in private Quarrels, or in wants and ſtraits, and then War is an admirable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge for them. And to palliate all, 'tis the eaſieſt thing in the world to play the Hypocrite, and pretend the <hi>Cauſe of God and Religion,</hi> when all that is at bottom is only <hi>Rapine</hi> or <hi>Revenge.</hi> Wherefore it being not at all out of the way to publick Peace, to provide for keeping the private, admit a few words thereof.</p>
                  <p>And the firſt means hereto, is for men
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106284:75"/> to be <hi>fully and honeſtly imployed.</hi> I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Plenty, Eaſe, Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs and Idleneſs have produced this Humour; Induſtry, Buſineſs, Labour and Sobriety would ſoon cure it, and lay the foundations of private Peace.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106284:76"/> thy ſelf to a ſecond, accordingly as he does, who turns his cheek to receive another. And I pray you conſider the reaſonableneſs of not meditating Revenge, or exacting punctual Satisfaction in all ſuch ſmal inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or affronts. Is the Vindication of thy ſelf, or gaining Right in ſo trivial points worth the inquietude of mind, the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance and turmoil it coſts? moſt times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it requires more than meerly work of Thought to right our ſelves; ſo that I may truly ſay, the Satisfaction, if juſtly eſtimated, will not quit a mans pains to get it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If you would have your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and Neighbourhood in Peace, be not <hi>curiouſly inquiſitive</hi> into others actions and affairs: for they, who are ſo, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to themſelves and Neighbours per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Concernments, unneceſſary Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in the end Differences and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet: They who will be knowing what every one does or ſays, ſhall never be at peace either in themſelves or with their Neighbours. This inquiſitive Humour is a ſore and frequent evil, ſo frequent that in moſt Cities or populous Towns there are ſeveral Houſes, whither a man may go and be informed better of the little affairs of his own Family, Children and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106284:76"/> Servants, than he himſelf is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. An accurſed Quality this, and which generally proceeds from a very ill Nature, and therefore it is no wonder if it be of ſo ill a Tendency, as I have affirm'd it: but ſhould it ſpring only from imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Curioſity, it ought to be curbed by us in our ſelves and others. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> vii. 21. <hi>Take no heed unto all words that are ſpoken, leſt thou hear thy Servant curſe thee:</hi> that is, as the phraſe ſignifies with the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, ſpeak ſlightingly, diſhonourably or reproachfully of thee. <hi>For oftentimes alſo thine own heart knoweth that thou thy ſelf haſt curſed others.</hi> Theſe little Offences are ordinary, and of common courſe; nor canſt thou but be ſenſible that thou haſt many a time done as much as this comes to by others, that are as much thy bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as thou art ſuperiour to thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. And if it be not prudence, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Wiſemans Judgment, to take heed of ſuch matters, then much more neither will it be virtuous <hi>to ſearch out iniquities,</hi> yea <hi>to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſ. lxiv. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>a diligent ſearch</hi> after other mens manners, who are to ſtand or fall to their own Maſters. We are to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it is not likely we ſhould be able to reform all that is amiſs in the world:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106284:77"/> we ſhall ſurely diſquiet our ſelves, and exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate others againſt us, by our prying into things that do not concern us. <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum habita—</hi>Examine and reform thy ſelf, and it will both bring and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thee peace.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Let me add, as another mean to private Peace, what is much akin to the former Advice, <hi>Liſten not to Tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers.</hi> There is ſcarce any Friendſhip ſo ſtrong, which a Generation of Tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers will not ſever. <hi>Prov.</hi> xvi. 28. <hi>A Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perer ſeparateth chief Friends;</hi> and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the verſe tells us how he does it, namely, <hi>by ſowing ſtrife.</hi> It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore if in Neighbourhoods, where the ties of mutual Love are, God knows, too too weak, (where it is well if one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily have not a Jealouſy over another) one Tatling perſon makes more Feuds than an hundred wiſe or good men can compoſe. Let ſuch perſons therefore be baniſhed out of that Houſe, where it is deſired Peace ſhould dwell: at leaſt, give them not the encouragement to hear their Stories; for that both begets and foſters them.

If it be true, perhaps it was a ſlip, the effect of ſome paſſion or diſorder; and the honeſt man will be ſorry for it, and give thee ſatisfaction: If ſo, <hi>then thou haſt gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy Brother:</hi> inſtead of an Enemy thou haſt him for ever a firmer Friend. This is it which the Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> following <hi>Solomons</hi> ſteps, moſt excellently adviſeth. <hi>(Eccleſiaſticus</hi> xix. 13, 14, 15.) <hi>Admoniſh a Friend, it may be he hath not done it: and if he have done it, that he do it no more.

                     <hi>Theſe things,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John, I write to you that you ſin not; But if any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous, and he is the Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our Sins.</hi> 1 Joh. II. 1, 2. Our firſt care ſhould be not to ſin: but if (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven after our former Repentance) we are again overtaken with ſin, and ſuch which wounds the Conſcience, the next care muſt be to betake our ſelves to our Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation: and it is his Promiſe, <hi>In me ye ſhall have Peace.</hi> Joh. xvi. 33.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. Whoſoever thou art, that deſireſt Peace of Conſcience, <hi>ſuffer not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſcruple</hi> long to lie upon thee: If thou canſt not by Prayer and private Thought, or ſome like way remove it thy ſelf, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately crave Help: Wounds which go long unbound up, are moſt difficult to heal, and ſometimes, by continued neglect, grow incurable. Whereas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt has appointed and provided Miniſters of Peace and Reconciliation, make uſe of their private Miniſtry as well as their publick.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106284:79"/> Spots of the Bloud they ſpilt could never be waſht out of them: and I have been ſhewed a Sword, out of which, as has been affirm'd to me, the Skill and Pains of all the Sword-Dreſſers could never work the Stain of Bloud. Be thoſe things how they ſhall, it is moſt ſure the Guilt of Bloud ſticks deep on every Conſcience where it once fixeth. It is very hardly purged or got off from mens Minds, who have any Conſciences. Wherefore it is no leſs neceſſary even to Peace in your ſelves, than to Peace in the Kingdom, that you liſten not to the Counſels or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of men, who are ſo ready for Wars. Account them to be what they are, the Plague and Reproach of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Nations, to be avoided and abhorred by all good men. But I muſt conclude, and I will truſt we have none of this kind of men amongſt us: If you find any of them, remember the courſe before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, neither to be of their Councils, nor to keep what you know unconcealed.</p>
                  <p>I have thus endeavoured faithfully to ſet before you the way to Peace; to Peace in the Kingdom, and in the Church; to Peace in the Neighbourhood, and in the Family: and finally to Peace with God
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106284:79"/> in our own Conſciences. The God of Peace make us all careful in the Practice of what has been ſaid, and crown us all with the Bleſſing of ſuch Peace.</p>

I parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>preſs'd</hi> that part of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the King,</hi> which I
<pb facs="tcp:106284:82"/> had aſſigned to conſiſt in <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all kinds,</hi> and ſo in <hi>Praiſing God</hi> in his behalf. I urged this laſt point of <hi>Praiſe</hi> by conſideration,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Wherein are two Duties manifeſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned us, one to God, <hi>Fear God.</hi> The other to the King, <hi>Honour the King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of <hi>each</hi> of theſe we will treat, firſt <hi>ſingly, or apart;</hi> then of the <hi>Connexion of both,</hi> which I affirm to be ſo far conſtant (at leaſt of the one ſide) and ſo indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble, that <hi>whoſoever does fear God will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I begin with the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe <hi>(the Fear of God)</hi> not only becauſe it ſtands firſt in my Text, but alſo becauſe it is in order of Nature the trueſt and only ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the other. All Duties towards men, when ſincerely payed, muſt have their foundation in our Dutifulneſs towards God. When our Lord had occaſion to touch on the true and natural Order of Chriſtian Duties, he tells us this <hi>is the firſt and great Commandment</hi> (Matth. xxii. 37, 38.) that we <hi>love the Lord our God with all our Heart, with all our Mind, with all our Soul, and with all our Strength. And the ſecond is, That we love our Neighbour as our ſelves;</hi> teaching us hereby, that we can never love our Neighbour as we ſhould do, except firſt we moſt entirely love God. The loving God with all our hearts can only ſweeten and influence our Souls
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106284:86"/> into an univerſal Charity. And propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably in the preſent caſe, the Fear of God can alone implant in our hearts uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and invariable Loyalty. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt confeſs I cannot ſee, how vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men can be true Loyaliſts. Natural Love, Education, Intereſt, Fear, and other like cauſes may beget and nouriſh a ſhort temporary and partial Allegiance. The vileſt men may be <hi>ſubject for Wrath,</hi> but good men only will be ſubject, as the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt directs, <hi>for Conſcience ſake.</hi> And ſuch Loyalty will be impartial, indefecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and eternally cordial. Briefly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the firſt place of the Fear of God. Now by the <hi>Fear of God</hi> we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, <hi>ſuch a conſtant Senſe or Aw of God, of his Sovereign Dominion, Power, Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Juſtice, as reſtrains us from Sin, and quickens us to Duty.</hi> The Fear of God therefore [firſt] <hi>ſuppoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s</hi> moſt deeply root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our hearts a <hi>real Belief of his Being,</hi> and a <hi>ſober Knowledge of his Nature.</hi> He who doubts whether there be a God, or is either ignorant or dubious of the truth of his infinite Perfections, can never have in his heart a true Fear of him. For as that Fear preſuppoſes, I ſay, ſuch Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Belief, ſo [ſecondly] it <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in</hi> (at leaſt moſt proximately and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106284:87"/> flows from or depends upon) <hi>a conſtant</hi> (actual or virtual) <hi>Attention</hi> to what we thus underſtand and believe of him. The thoughts of him, and of theſe his Perfections are generally, ever and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non recurring, and by that means habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fixed in the mind. The Thoughts I mean,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of <hi>his Sovereign Dominion</hi> and <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> over all. He alone <hi>is King of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> (Jerem. x. 7.) ſupream and moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute over all Peoples, and Kingdoms, and Languages; and over each individual Man. And therefore <hi>who ſhall not fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, O thou King of Nations, for to thee it doth appertain; foraſmuch as amongst all the wiſe men of the Nations, and in all their Kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Together herewith do the thoughts of his <hi>Omniſcience</hi> (or actually knowing all things) poſſeſs the heart; for begetting in it that Temper which we call the Fear of God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> cxxxix. 2, 3, 4, 6. <hi>Thou knoweſt my down-ſitting and mine up-riſing, thou underſtandeſt my thoughts afar off; thou compaſſeſt my path and my lying down, and art neer unto all my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but lo, O Lord, thou knoweſt it altogether. Such Knowledge is too wonderful for me, it is high, I cannot attain</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:106284:87"/> 
                     <hi>unto it.</hi> In other words, it is not poſſible for any of us ſo intimately to know our our ſelves, as God knows us. I cannot tell what I ſhall think, or what I ſhall not think to morrow, perhaps not an hour hence. But God <hi>knoweth my thoughts while they are yet afar off.</hi> He by one ſimple in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible act ſees all things, perſons and actions, paſt, preſent and to come. And whereas the <hi>Heart of man is deceitful and deſperately wicked,</hi> ſo that a man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>knows not</hi> all the Wickedneſs of his own heart; <hi>The Lord ſearcheth the Hearts, and tryeth the Reins of the Children of Men,</hi> all their Counſels and Contrivances, all their hidden acts of Malice or Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence are open and bare to him. And therefore who can but fear before him? Eſpecially conſidering, what alſo is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ingredient or ground to the Fear of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That this ſame Omniſcient God is alſo <hi>moſt juſt and holy.</hi> Moſt holy, ſo as that he can no wiſe approve or allow Sin. <hi>Habbak</hi> I. 13. <hi>Thou art of purer Eyes than to behold Evil, and canſt not look on Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity:</hi> that is, God moſt perfectly abhors it.

                  <p>Add hereto, laſtly, the attending to, or conſideration of his <hi>infinite Might &amp; Power.</hi> As he hath reſolved and <hi>will bring every work into Judgment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil,</hi> (Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. vii. laſt.) ſo is he able to effect it. No Malefactors can poſſibly fly from, or eſcape this Judge: he has Emiſſaries e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough (millions of Angels good and bad) to fetch all in. And <hi>all ſhall appear before the Judgement-ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that he hath done,</hi> 2 Cor. v. 10.</p>
                  <p>Let us now put all theſe together: Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106284:88"/> a man believes and actually thinks, there is a great and glorious Majeſty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen indeed, but ſeeing all, who is Lord of Heaven and Earth, and all in them; this God is moſt holy and moſt juſt, both reſolved and able to bring all things into Judgment, even to the very imaginations of the thought of mens hearts; muſt not there needs amount hence a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Aw and Dread of this great God? And muſt not this Fear both reſtrain ſuch in whoſe Breaſts it is conceived from wicked practices, and excite and awaken them to all well-doing? Thus then we have moſt plainly heard what the Fear of God is, and together how it is begotten in the heart, what roots or foundation it has.</p>
                  <p>Now for the ſecond Duty <hi>Honour the King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Honour</hi> imports or ſignifies an <hi>inward Eſteem</hi> and <hi>outward Reſpect</hi> paid to any, by reaſon of the Excellency we apprehend in them. Thus in the beginning of this verſe, <hi>Honour all men:</hi> For ſome Excellency there is in all men, that is, in <hi>every man,</hi> more than in any other Creatures we know. The <hi>Image of God</hi> is impreſs'd upon the pooreſt, which whoſo obſerves, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, muſt needs pay an Eſteem
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106284:89"/> and Reſpect, that is, an Honour thereto. But in the preſent caſe, more ſignally, <hi>Kings</hi> are <hi>Gods Image, doubly</hi> or <hi>trebiy.</hi> Firſt, as <hi>Men</hi> by Creation; Then as <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> by Regeneration; And further, by by their <hi>Office,</hi> as <hi>Gods Vicegerents.</hi> They repreſent him, and are as in the place of God within their Dominions and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; They are <hi>the Ordinance of God,</hi> Rom. xiii. 2. <hi>the Miniſters,</hi> or immediate Agents, <hi>of God</hi> ver. 4. and therefore fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in Scripture called <hi>Gods;</hi> twice even in one <hi>Pſalm</hi> lxxxii. 1, and 6. Now becauſe greater Excellency cannot be in any than in God; therefore to no other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs greater or equal Honour. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Kings on Earth are Gods Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, therefore to none on Earth is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Honour due than unto Kings: ſo much reaſon for this Duty do the very terms in which it is expreſſed moſt evidently and intimately import. But it is requiſite we take a more diſtinct view of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which this comprehenſive general in the Text doth involve. We will therefore expreſly put the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> What are the great Branches of that Honor, which by the Chriſtian Law Subjects ow to their Prince?</p>
                  <p>In anſwer whereto I conceive the ſum of all may be reduced to the ſave following heads.</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:106284:89"/>
                  <p> 1. We owe to our King by the Law of Chriſt the <hi>Honour of Obedience.</hi> And for proof hereof, becauſe ſome people will admit nothing to be our Duty, which is not plainly made ſo by one of the Ten Commandments, I could be content at preſent to go no further than the Fifth Commandment; <hi>Honour thy Father and Mother; Civil</hi> as well as <hi>Natural.</hi> Thy <hi>King</hi> as well as <hi>Parents.</hi> That Father and Mother ought to be interpreted here with this Latitude, I prove from hence, that there is no other of the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, which will take in the <hi>Sixth</hi> of theſe <hi>Seven Precepts</hi> which the Jewiſh Doctors call the Precepts of the <hi>Sons of Noah,</hi> and tell us they were in the world as the great Rule of Life or Manners long before <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law. That Precept is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>of Judgments</hi> or <hi>Obedience to the Civil Magiſtrate,</hi> and muſt, I ſay, be included in the Fifth Commandment, or elſe (which is not credible) is totally omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and reducible to none. Whence would follow that the Law written by Gods own Finger were more imperfect, than the Traditionary one, which was in the world before it: which, I preſume, all whom I have to deal with abhorr to think. Then, that the <hi>Honour</hi> here required will extend to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106284:90"/> 
                     <hi>Obedience,</hi> there can be no clearer proof, than the moſt exemplary inſtance of the <hi>Rechabites</hi> keeping this Commandment, in obſerving their Father <hi>Rechabs</hi> Injunctions, ſo much celebrated by God himſelf, <hi>Jer.</hi> xxxv. ſo that in ſhort, they who contend for withdrawing Obedience to Kings out of the Liſt of Chriſtian Duties, as far as in them lies, take away a main branch of one of the Ten Commandments. But if we pleaſe to look into the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and will take ſatisfaction thence of our Chriſtian Duty (as I think is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) we need not go ſo far about. Hear what Doctrine St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires <hi>Titus,</hi> whom he ordained Biſhop of <hi>Crete,</hi> to preach to his Flock, <hi>Tit.</hi> II. laſt, and III. 1. <hi>Theſe things,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſpeak, and exhort with all Authority. Let no man deſpiſe thee. Put them in mind to be ſubject to Principalities and Powers;</hi> and what he means by that Subjection, immediately he expreſſes in the next word, <hi>To obey,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which our Tranſlators indeed have rendred; <hi>To obey Magiſtrates.</hi> And if we underſtand the words as we ought, and as parallel pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces enforce, of ſubmitting our ſelves or being obedient <hi>to the King as Supream, and Governours</hi> or Magiſtrates <hi>as ſent by him,</hi> (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> II. 13, 14.) there is no danger in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106284:90"/> the Tranſlation. But if any of us ſhould be infected with the Humour of ſome men, that there is a ſort of Magiſtrates which are coordinate, or all taken together ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, to the King, and that 'tis theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates only which we owe Obedience to, and another kind of Honour may ſerve the King; then it is fit we be admonſht, that the word <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> is not <hi>in the Original,</hi> nor indeed in <hi>any Tranſlation,</hi> that I can find, before thoſe of <hi>Calvin</hi> &amp; <hi>Geneva.</hi> And whether put in only, that the Text might more expreſly favour the popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here may be worth conſideration.

                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond Honour, which we owe to him, is that of <hi>Fealty and Allegiance.</hi> The word <hi>Fealty</hi> ſignifies only <hi>Fidelity</hi> or <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs:</hi> and what the particulars of the Faith we owe to our Sovereign Lord the King are, we know all of us by the Oath of Allegiance. In particular, as we are not to be falſe Traytors our ſelves, ſo neither are we to connive at, or conceal, thoſe whom we have reaſon to ſuſpect to be ſuch. And hereunto we are all of us bound.</p>
                  <p>Firſt. By the <hi>Oath</hi> aforementioned, which that none may think an Impoſition upon us, or contrary to the Laws of God, or to our Chriſtian Liberty, behold it in the very Kingdom of <hi>Judah;</hi> that is, in the Kingdom which of all ever on Earth was that of Gods moſt peculiar Erection and Care. We had juſt now one proof of it out of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes; I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel thee to keep the Kings Commandment by reaſon of the Oath of God:</hi> that Oath we cannot well conceive to be any other than the Oath of Allegiance, which they, to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106284:93"/> whom he ſpeaks, had taken to their King, and particularly to King <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Penman of that Book. But in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> laſt, 24. You have both the time, and manner or ceremony of taking it; <hi>Then</hi> Solomon <hi>ſat on the Throne of the Lord as King inſtead of</hi> David <hi>his Father—And all the Princes and the mighty Men, and all the Sons of King</hi> David <hi>gave the Hand under</hi> Solomon; ſo the Text runs in the Hebrew, as you may ſee in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of your Bibles. And what that kind of ſpeech ſignifies, you may learn out of the Story of <hi>Abrahams Servant,</hi> Gen. xxiv. 2, 3. <hi>Put, I pray thee,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Abraham</hi> to his Servant) <hi>thine Hand under my Thigh, and I will make thee ſwear by the Lord the God of Heaven and the God of Earth.</hi> The giving the Hand under one was the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a moſt ſolemn Oath <hi>By the Lord,</hi> that is, <hi>By</hi> Jehovah <hi>the God of Heaven and the God of Earth.</hi> So again when <hi>Jacob</hi> was dying in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he ſent for his Son <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and ſaid unto him, <hi>Put, I pray thee, thine Hand under my Thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; Bury me not in</hi> Egypt, <hi>but I will lie with my Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And he ſaid, ſwear unto me, and he ſware unto him.</hi> Geneſ. xxvii. 29, 30, 31. So that this their <hi>giving their</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:106284:93"/> 
                     <hi>Hand under King</hi> Solomon, was ſwearing to him, in perſon, their Faith and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. You ſee then Divine Warrant for an Oath of Allegiance: And hereby firſt, I ſay, are we bound to pay our King the Honour of Fidelity: for this Oath we have all of us taken; or if any of us be ſo young as not to have taken it, ſuch are to be minded, that we here all of us call our ſelves <hi>Engliſh-men.</hi> And <hi>every Engliſh-man is born,</hi> as I may ſay, <hi>with the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance in his mouth:</hi> our Fathers took it, and ſtand bound for us, and we therefore bound in them.</p>
                  <p>2. We are bound hereto by the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Equity and Juſtice,</hi> thoſe common grounds of the <hi>Laws of Nations,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>true Law of Nature.</hi> We expect Protection from the King, his Laws and Government; and, God be bleſſed, we do enjoy it. Now is it not juſt, that as we have Safety from him, ſo he ſhould have Security from us? What Nation is there, which gives not this Security to their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? Indeed it is the very Bond of Government, without which it cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, but all muſt run into Seditions, Bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, Confuſion &amp; Anarchy: And therefore,</p>
                  <p>3. We are bound to pay our King the Honour of Faith and Allegiance <hi>in our own</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:106284:94"/> 
                     <hi>Defence:</hi> There are many who pretend, and have long pretended (God forgive them) to be afraid of their Property, Liberties and Religion.</p>
                  <p>My Brethren, what can more certainly and fatally expoſe or deſtroy all theſe, than Civil Wars? And Civil Wars muſt needs immediately come in upon us, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us (at leaſt any number of us) ſtart or ſwerve from our Allegiance. Our King (under God alone) is able to protect us, our Properties, Liberties &amp; Religion: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his Force &amp; Power, he has manifeſted to the World, Courage, Will and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enough to protect us. In ſtanding ſtedfaſt therefore, we ſecure and preſerve our ſelves and ours: but if we ſtagger or fall off (which God forbid) we may wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him, but we ſhall deſtroy our ſelves. I will add no more on this Point: I truſt I do not need. Thus then as to the <hi>ſecond</hi> branch of Honour due to the King, the Honour of Fealty and Allegiance, and our Obligations thereto. The third follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly</hi> then, We owe to our King, by the Laws of Chriſt, the <hi>Honour of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies and of paying Tribute.</hi> Kings muſt not be kept poor, for this is the way to make them uſeleſs, and to expoſe both them and their Subjects to the common
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106284:94"/> Enemies of both. You know whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it is, <hi>Render unto</hi> Ceſar <hi>the things that are</hi> Ceſars, <hi>and unto God the things that are Gods.</hi> Matth. xxii. 21. The Juſtice of which debt the Apoſtle gives us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>Rom.</hi> xiii. 6. <hi>For this cauſe pay we Tribute alſo, for they are Gods Miniſters attending continually upon this very thing,</hi> the thing he had ſpoken of in the fourth Verſe, namely, <hi>the publick Good:</hi> or in his language, <hi>to miniſter to every one for good;</hi> for the <hi>private good of each</hi> who <hi>doth good,</hi> and for the <hi>publick good of all</hi> by <hi>executing Wrath upon ſuch as do evil.</hi> Now there is no greater burden than the perpetual Care, Toil and Difficulty which lies on Kings and Perſons in the higheſt Power, in reference to ſuch Adminiſtration of Juſtice, and other like publick affairs. And if our own private buſineſs and concerns cannot be carried on without Expence, what muſt be the Charge of the Concerns of a Kingdom? Wherefore, as the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going ſuch publick Cares and perpetual Anxieties deſerves a publick and ample Reward (greater Wealth and Revenues than thoſe of any private man) ſo the Neceſſiities of publick Buſineſs require greater Treaſures to diſcharge them. Hence, I ſay, is moſt evident the Juſtice
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106284:95"/> of the caſe, that Tributes and Supplies ſhould be paid to Kings.</p>
                  <p>Let them be paid then, will ſome ſay, by them that reap the great benefit of the Government: but how will it be proved to be every mans Duty to pay them?</p>
                  <p>The Anſwer is eaſie, (1.) Who reaps not the benefit of the Government, and particularly the benefit of Protection by the Laws, both as to his Perſon, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, Liberty, good Name and the like? except he have deſerved otherwiſe. He owes therefore for theſe, his ſhare towards the defraying the publick Expences. But there is yet a farther Anſwer, (2.) We muſt know, the King has the ſame right to ſuch Supplies as we ſpeak of, to Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and his Revenues, as any of us have to our Eſtates.</p>
                  <l>Nam propriae Telluris herum natura ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que illum</l>
                  <l>Nec me, nec quenquam ſtatuit—</l>
                  <p>Nature gives no man a property to his Houſe, or Lands, or like poſſeſſions. It is the Law that determines and ſets out each mans property. And the ſame Law that metes out to me, what is mine, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106284:95"/> to the King what is his. The ſame Law, that gives me liberty to traffick, to buy up, and export, and import Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, allots to the King his Cuſtomes: and it is as much a <hi>breach</hi> of the <hi>eighth Commandent</hi> (whatſoever ſome men think of it) to <hi>ſteal Cuſtome,</hi> as to pick a mans pocket; of the two in ſome regard a greater.</p>
                  <p>I know the ordinary Evaſion many have, with which they do not ſo much quiet, as for a while cheat or ſtifle their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>The Laws</hi> in this caſe, ſay they, are <hi>penal:</hi> if we ſubmit to the Penalty of the Law, as we are content to do, when we are caught (which I muſt ſuſpect, and they who ſay it would do well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether they ſo contentedly ſubmit to legal Forfeitures as they pretend in this plea) if <hi>we ſubmit to the Penalty,</hi> ſay they, <hi>we are guiltleſs,</hi> we have fulfilled the Law. I <hi>utterly deny this;</hi> and ſo will any man, who underſtands any thing of Caſuaſtical Divinity. The Law by commanding me to do what will ſecure me from Penalty or Forfeiture, commands me not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur that Penalty or Forfeiture: if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wittingly incur it, I break the Law, except there were more particular <hi>Salvo's</hi> than I have ſeen in any of our penal Laws.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:106284:96"/>
                  <p> But becauſe ſome will not underſtand this in the general, let me put a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſe: Suppoſe a man by defrauding the King of ſome (comparatively) ſmall Dues, incurs a Forfeiture, which undoes him; Who now is guilty of undoing this man, the Law or himſelf? If he would have honeſtly paid the King ſuch Dues, as he might have done, and yet been an honeſt Gainer, (which was the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Law, and by the Law his Duty) he had been in a good condition: but he chooſes to break the Law, and ſo has undone himſelf. Is he not now dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly gulty? firſt of a ſin againſt the Law and the King. Secondly, is he not in ſome meaſure a <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> at leaſt a Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of himſelf and Family? and the Guilt muſt needs bear its proportion, and be Guilt ſtill, though not ſo great, in caſe of leſſer Penalties and Forfeitures. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee we owe the King the Honour of Supplies, Cuſtom or Tribute.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly. We owe him the <hi>Honour of Candour and charitable Conſtruction,</hi> of thinking and ſpeaking the beſt we can of him and all his actions. You never knew a perſon, who truly honoured another, but he would be ſo far from thinking vilely of his indifferent actions (mean of ſuch actions,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106284:96"/> which might be capable of being done wiſely, or to a good end, as well as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) that he would find out excuſes for his bad ones. I pray you let us all pay our Prince this Honour; at leaſt, let none of us be guilty of interpreting to the worſt, ſuch Counſels and Actions, the reaſons of which we do not yet (and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it is not fit we ſhould at preſent) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. This very practice, beſides that it is moſt certainly our Duty to our King, would be no ſmall ſervice to our ſelves and neighbours: for it would prevent a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of thoſe cauſeleſs, but very torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Fears and Jealoufies, nay even many divers reports too, which are very frequent all over the Kingdoms. But this I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly otherwiſe preſt.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, We owe to our King the <hi>Honour of our Prayers</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Theſe paſſages were put in when the Sermon was preached a ſecond time, in another place, and on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother occaſion.</note> [and of our Praiſes too] in his behalf. True Honour and Love are inſeparable. And 'tis moſt ſure no perſon of any ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Religion ever honoured and loved any man, whom he did not pray for * [and in whoſe good he would not cordially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and praiſe God for it.] Remember that moſt ſolemn paſſage of the Apoſtle
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106284:97"/> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> II. 1, 2, 3. <hi>I exhort therefore firſt of all, that Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and giving of Thanks be made for all men: for Kings and for all that are in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that we may lead a quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty. For this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour.</hi> It is plain hence, that in the ſettling of the Service of God in the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> one of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> firſt and chiefeſt cares, one of his ſtricteſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions was, that all <hi>ſorts of Prayers</hi> ſhould be offered up in the behalf of <hi>Kings;</hi> which I have otherwiſe more largely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed, and therefore for the preſent more briefly paſs.</p>
                  <p>We ſee then now the main particulars of that Honour we are to pay the King by the Law of Chriſt. The <hi>Honour of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> of <hi>Faith and Allegiance,</hi> of <hi>Supplies and Tributes,</hi> of <hi>Candour and charitable Thoughts,</hi> and laſtly of our <hi>Prayers of all kinds.</hi>

                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. And all this is true will ſome ſay; yes, it were fit too to be practiſed, were Kings ſuch as they ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. As to this vile Suggeſtion (which it is too plain many more men harbour than dare ſpeak out) I might only give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the ſame Anſwer, I have formerly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106284:97"/> given, and ſay, in one word; we can find no fault in our King, but what is more the three Nations, than his own Guilt. Our former Crimes therefore, and the Effects they have had upon him, cannot but moſt iniquitouſly and unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianly be made Arguments for withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our preſent Duties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. But once again; Secondly: Conſider, I pray you, the <hi>Text</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,</hi> the <hi>emphaſis</hi> both bear, the <hi>Time</hi> in which, and the <hi>Perſons</hi> to which, both were ſpoken, and if we have not ſuch an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer hence to this Objectin, as will make us all aſhamed ſo much as to think of withholding any branch of the Honour mentioned due to our King, I am much miſtaken. As to the <hi>Time;</hi> it is moſt certain this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> muſt be writ either in the time of <hi>Claudius</hi> or <hi>Nero's Empire,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Baronius</hi> in the formers: be it under whichſoever of the two, they were both not only Heathens and Enemies to Chriſtianity, but villanouſly vitious Then as to the <hi>Perſons,</hi> if we conſider to whom the Apoſtle directs theſe his Commands, not only in general to all the Chriſtian multitude, but more eſpecially to the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed Chriſtian Jews in Pontus, Aſia, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:106284:98"/> this contributes further to the utter avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the force can be conceived in this Objection. The Jews we know were a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple peculiarly choſen by God, and by him priviledged above all Nations: amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Promiſes made them, that of dominion over the Nations was one, eſpecially eyed by them; and nothing did they expect more conſtantly or paſſionately by the Meſſias, then temporal Empire. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to this people, and to the Chriſtian (that is, the beſt) part of them, doth the very <hi>Apoſtle of the Circumciſion</hi> preach Subjection, Honour and Obedience even towards Heathen Emperours and Princes. Now weigh the whole Emphaſis: Was it thus particularly and expreſly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the primitive (that is, the pureſt and moſt excellent Race of) Chriſtians, that have lived in any ages of the world, that they ſhould be dutiful and obedient to their Princes, though the worſt of men? Were theſe ſame Commands too in common, &amp; without any exemption impoſed upon the Jews, that people peculiarly pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged, as it would ſeem, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? Nay, were they, as by name re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be ſubject and obedient to all the Kings of the Nations they ſhould live under? Were the Sons of God (as I may
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106284:98"/> ſtile them) thus required to yield Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Aliens, and men without God in the world, and can now any of us think, that, upon ſome private Reaſons of our own, we may forbear, or do not owe, like Duty to our Native Liege-Lord and Sovereign, the ſame a mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Wherefore if the Fear of God ſo far ſway in our hearts, that it control, govern and direct our Actions, we ſhall be loyal as well as devout; for there is the ſame Divine Law and Authority for both: and if in one point we caſt off the Fear of God, 'tis vain to pretend it in another the ſame Fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were it ſincere and real, would operate to all caſes as well as one.

We have ſeen the true riſe of that Fear, and its genuine Nature. It is a laſting ſenſe of the Being, Sovereignty, Omniſcience, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Power of God. Inure your ſelves then to think much hereon, and to attend hereto in all your actions.

                  <p>THis Sermon was preached only in the place and on the time and occaſion mentioned. The <hi>Specialties</hi> of its <hi>Deſign</hi> may not perhaps be fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, either by its <hi>Title</hi> or by the <hi>Text;</hi> And therefore I thought fit to premoniſh, that I aimed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in peculiarly at theſe <hi>Two Points: Firſt,</hi> to conciliate, the moſt I could, to our preſent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign in <hi>particular</hi> the <hi>good Opinion</hi> and <hi>hearty Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of all ſorts of People.

                     <hi>young and tender-hearted,</hi> 2 Chron. xiii. 7. All which acceptations are neceſſary here to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the oppoſite hereof, <hi>the Son of Nobles,</hi> in the Text, may be better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Eating in the Morning, &amp;c.</hi> we ſhall touch by and by. In the mean while the ſum of this his firſt Obſervation is, That it is generally a great unhappineſs for a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have either a young, ignoble, ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or voluptuous Prince. God be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, our Kings vileſt Enemies can affix none of theſe to him.</p>
                  <p>But contrarily, <hi>Bleſſed art thou, O Land, when thy King is the Son of Nobles, and thy Princes eat in due ſeaſon, for Strength, and not for Drunkenneſs.</hi> That term, <hi>the Son of Nobles,</hi> is capable of a double ſenſe: <hi>Strictly</hi> and literally taken, it ſignifies, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>a Perſon of Noble Extraction,</hi> or deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a Noble Family. But taken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Hebrew Idiom,</hi> as we ſay the <hi>Sons of Men,</hi> that is <hi>Men;</hi> ſo the <hi>Son of Nobles</hi> will be <hi>a Perſon of a noble Spirit,</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, great and brave. Nothing hinders but we may underſtand the term both ways. And in the Interpretation of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, where ſeveral ſenſes are probable and wholeſome, it is, as one calls it, a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106284:108"/> piece of ſpiritual Frugality to take both, or even <hi>all.</hi> It is indeed an holy making the moſt of Scripture. And if we regard what was ſaid before in the Explication of the word <hi>Child</hi> in the former verſe, that it ſignifies not only what we commonly mean by the name <hi>[a perſon of few years,]</hi> but alſo either one of a <hi>mean or ſervile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> or even of a <hi>weak and mean Soul,</hi> the Oppoſition which muſt be admitted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two branches <hi>[Wo be to thee, O Land, when thy King is a Child]</hi> and <hi>[Bleſſed be thou, O Land, when thy King is the Son of Nobles]</hi> will enforce us to take this term in both the ſenſes menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
                  <p>Then as to what may ſee, dubious or obſcure in the latter clauſe of the Text; <hi>Eating in due ſeaſon, for Strength, and not for Drunkenneſs,</hi> ſeems at firſt only a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of temperate Diet. <hi>Eating in due ſeaſon,</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>Eating in the morning.</hi> The morning is no ſeaſon for men to ſet themſelves to Eating; but firſt for Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then for Buſineſs. <hi>Eating for Strength, and not for Drunkenneſs</hi> determines both the <hi>Quantity and Quality of our Food.</hi> For it is plain, men may make themſelves drunk with a ſmall meaſure of ſome kind of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, as well as with a large one of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106284:109"/> Theſe three therefore, To Eat and Drink in <hi>due ſeaſon,</hi> in <hi>due meaſure,</hi> and of <hi>ſuch viands</hi> as are <hi>convenient for us,</hi> make up what we call Temperance in Diet. But this <hi>ſingle Virtue,</hi> as being the <hi>principal</hi> part of <hi>Sobriety,</hi> and that which is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtrumental to preſerve Reaſon and Conſideration, is put <hi>Synecdochically</hi> for a <hi>conſiderative Virtuous Temper</hi> and <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;</hi> in oppoſition, eſpecially, to a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous and ſenſual Life; which, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever give themſelves up to, whether no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or plebeian, are neither ſit for, nor can mind or happily diſpath, Buſineſs. And ſo the ſum of the Royal Preachers Obſervation in the Text amounts to this; <hi>'Tis a ſingular Bleſſing to a Nation to have a King nobly deſcended, of a noble Mind, not young or unexperienc'd, not giving himſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Pleaſures and exceſs, but grave, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemious, conſiderative and virtuous.</hi> And all this, praiſed be our good God, is a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs which theſe Nations at preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.</p>
                  <p>The Text being thus explained, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that we ſpeak diſtinctly to its parts: which I ſhall not be curious in aſſigning. It being a compound or copulative Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, conſiſts evidently of two ſimple ones, the firſt whereof is, <hi>Bleſſed art thou,</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:106284:109"/> 
                     <hi>O Land, when thy King is the Son of Nobles.</hi> We ought then firſt to conſider, what Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities they are, which amount to a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by having their Prince of Noble Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</p>
                  <p>And in anſwer hereto, if my Diſcourſe be not at preſent ſo perfectly or wholly Theological, as I could deſire, or, as are generally thoſe, with which I uſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain you, I muſt beg your pardon: the nature of the Subject matter does not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it: But, I am ſure, the End I drive at, or that to which all tends, is truly Holy, Religious and Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>Now the great Benefits which reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a People may expect under ſuch a Prince are, I think, chiefly theſe three.</p>
                  <l>Publik Wealth and Plenty;</l>
                  <l>Publick Eaſe, or Liberty to enjoy what they have; And</l>
                  <l>Publick Quiet and Peace.</l>
                  <p>Bleſſings! which one would think ſhould endear the Government to us, and which, I am ſure, whether we will acknowledge or no, the Kingdoms generally enjoy; eſpecially if we conſider how at preſent it goes with other neighbouring Nations. And theſe, I ſay, by Gods Bleſſing, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106284:110"/> upon our own Loyalty, we may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expect the continuance of, under our <hi>Sovereign</hi> and the <hi>preſent Conſtitution,</hi> that is, while we are governed by <hi>Kings who are the Sons of Nobles.</hi> For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt. With <hi>Noble Perſonages</hi> generally go <hi>Noble Eſtates and Revenues.</hi> When men who were born Princes come to the Throne, they carry with them thither their private Fortunes and former Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities, joyning all to the Crowns they take. A great Felicity this to the Publick, and much for the aggrandiſing a Nation, as well as for the Eaſe of the middle rate of men, on whom commonly all burdens fall. <hi>Kings cannot be too rich, though Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may.</hi> 'Tis for the Benefit of the whole body of their People, that Princes abound. They will then be better able to defend both themſelves and Subjects; and that with fewer, lighter and more eaſie Supplies. On the contrary, where indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and poor men come to rule, though never ſo virtuous, upright and juſt, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſweet, generous and noble mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet <hi>[Neceſſitas cogit ad turpia]</hi> a poor Princes own, or the publick Neceſſities, will put him on Practices diſhonourable, and which will be uneaſie and grating on the the Subject. For what vaſt Treaſures are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106284:110"/> ceſſary to ſettle a new Prince? What un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of Expences incident? Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Exigents of State, private Accidents, Families to be raiſed, Dependants to be advanced, and a multitude of like occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Of all which the ordinary ſort muſt bear the main burden. Wherefore no ſuch Oppreſſor as a poor Man in chief Power. <hi>Prov.</hi> xxiii. 3. <hi>A poor man, that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the Poor, is like a ſweeping Rain, which leaveth no Food.</hi> Though therefore it was a King in the Text that ſaid it, yet it would ſeem of all Degrees the Commona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity may in this reſpect moſt juſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, <hi>Bleſſed art thou, O Land, when thy King is the Son of Nobles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly. The <hi>Sons of Nobles</hi> moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally <hi>prove Noble and Heroical themſelves,</hi> and of great and brave Souls. <hi>Fortes cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur fortibus &amp; bonis.</hi> Eagles naturally produce not Kites or Buzzards: There is a <hi>Royal Spirit</hi> runs in <hi>Royal Bloud.</hi> And it has been obſerved by the wiſeſt and moſt impartial men, ſuch which are beſt Judges in theſe matters, I mean, leaſt obnoxious to miſtake and freeſt from Flattery, that many <hi>Princes</hi> even while <hi>young,</hi> and within thoſe years which ordinarily denominate <hi>Children,</hi> have far <hi>ſurpaſt in ripeneſs</hi> of <hi>Wit, Prudence, Counſel</hi> or like Qualifications,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106284:111"/> the generality of <hi>adult perſons,</hi> of above twice their years, though of liberal and good lettered Education alſo. This, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, was manifeſt to all the world in that bleſſed Prince <hi>Edward</hi> VI. King of <hi>England,</hi> whom <hi>Cardan</hi> (an <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> by Birth as well as Religion, but one of the moſt learned men and greateſt Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers then in the world) having viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could not forbear wonder, and giving him ſo great a Character, as is ſcarce cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible touching one of ſo few years. It is too long to repeat the whole, but in the end he expreſly ſtiles him <hi>the Miracle of Nature.</hi> And it is truly much, to have been ever from the Cradle fill'd with great thoughts, poſſeſt with Principles and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of publick Good, and <hi>bred</hi> by <hi>Art,</hi> as well as by <hi>Nature diſpos'd</hi> and fram'd <hi>for Government.</hi> Now this <hi>may be expected</hi> from the <hi>Sons of Nobles,</hi> and is almoſt ever found in thoſe who are born Princes. They cannot well be baſe ſpirited, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their Originals and Condition of Life. From whence, how naturally the forementioned Advantages will flow to their Subjects, any may eaſily ſee who pleaſes to conſider the Caſe. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when men either by the <hi>Sword,</hi> or <hi>Popular Favour</hi> and <hi>Factions, come to the</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:106284:111"/> 
                     <hi>Throne,</hi> they <hi>retain</hi> dreadful <hi>tinctures</hi> of the <hi>Cruelty, Bloudineſs, Partiality</hi> or other <hi>baſe Arts,</hi> that advanced them. Whence it comes to paſs that they rule with Tyranny and Oppreſſion, at leaſt, that they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally adminiſter (pardon the ſoleciſm) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal and partial Juſtice: Where they dare to puniſh, they commonly (though on ſlight occaſions) cruſh irreparably: where they dare not, they will not ſee, but haply flatter or fawn, at leaſt baſely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, and perſonate Juſtice, only in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blind: And what Grievances, how great and various muſt ariſe hence, is not eaſie, I had almoſt ſaid to imagine, I am ſure not to comprehend or determine. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Jothans</hi> Parable, <hi>Judg.</hi> ix. 15. <hi>When the</hi> Bramble was advanced to be King <hi>over the</hi> Trees, <hi>he ſaid unto the Trees, if in truth ye anoint me King over you, then come and put your truſt in my Shadow: and if not, let Fire come out of the Bramble and devour the Cedars of</hi> Lebanon. The <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> is no ſuch tall, erect or ſtrong plant, that its ſhadow was likely, I ſhould have ſaid poſſible, to defend the Trees, from the injuries either of Storms or ſcorching Heat: Yet if the Trees would not accept of this its ſhelter, as inſignificant and ridiculous as it was, from ſuch a King, nothing but
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106284:112"/> conſuming Fire was to be expected even to the very goodlieſt Cedar. And the matter of fact proved ſuch in that very caſe to which this Parable was adapted. The <hi>men of Shechem</hi> (ver. 2. that is, the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſites</hi> and <hi>Ephraimites,</hi> that inhabited that City and its Territories) forgetting the Benefits they had received from <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baal,</hi> upon <hi>Abimelechs</hi> inſinuations and wheadling of them, <hi>choſe</hi> him, who was only <hi>Jerubaals</hi> Natural Son <hi>by an Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid</hi> of his, for their King, <hi>rejecting Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baals legitimate Iſſue;</hi> they furniſh him with Treaſure, wherewith <hi>he hired vain and light men that followed him,</hi> that is, wherewith he raiſed a kind of a paltry Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: By the aſſiſtance of theſe, he goes and cuts off all the legitimate Iſſue of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubaal, threeſcore and ten perſons on one ſtone:</hi> excepting only <hi>Jothan that fled.</hi> But ſoon after God was meet with him, and <hi>Jothans</hi> Curſe, which I before repeated, befell both him and them. <hi>God ſent an evil ſpirit between the men of</hi> Shechem <hi>and</hi> Abimelech. <hi>They dealt treacherouſly with one another.</hi> For they conſpire againſt him; he chaſeth them out of their City, kills and ſlays as many as he could, drives the reſt into a <hi>Caſtle,</hi> and by a ſtratagem <hi>burns a thouſand of them in the Caſtle,</hi> into which he had driven them.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106284:112"/> Thus almoſt literally, <hi>Fire comes out of the Bramble to conſume the Cedars.</hi> And in the end beſieging a Tower, into which another party of them had fled, <hi>he</hi> is <hi>himſelf</hi> knockt on the head by <hi>a piece of a Milſtone</hi> thrown down from the top of the Portal <hi>by a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> Thus back again <hi>Deſtruction comes</hi> out <hi>from a Shrub</hi> to <hi>conſume the very Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> They rend and tear one another, till the Baſtard Prince and his People mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly periſh by one anothers hand. Nor is this a ſingle or rare caſe, as to matter, at leaſt, of the Tyranny of ignoble perſons. It has been the Experience of all Ages and Countries, that there is no ſuch Cruelty and Invaſion on all mens Rights, Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and even Lives, as under upſtart Governments and Governours. But I ſhall not ſtand to multiply inſtances. I will only note, This is the firſt of the <hi>three things for which the Earth is disquieted, and which it cannot bear; For a Servant when he reigneth.</hi> Prov. xxx. 22. For they bring with them Spirits unequal to their new Place. Wherefore <hi>bleſſed art thou, O Land, when thy King is the Son of Nobles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly. The <hi>Title of Kings the Sons of Nobles</hi> is generally <hi>certain,</hi> and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, or coming to the Crown, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, uncontroverted, ſubmitted to and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106284:113"/> quieſced in by all. Now this is an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Benefit to a Nation,</hi> when Kings dye almoſt like other men, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as an Eſtate in Fee, deſcends to the rightful Heir, without noiſe and publick concuſſions: when there are no Earthquakes, as I may call them, in the Commonwealth, but as in the Succeſſion of other Noble Men to their Palaces, Lands and Honours, there is only the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of a ſingle perſon or two: If you come into the Family, you ſhall find few new Faces, but generally the Houſe looks all as it did; the old Servants ſtill fill their old Places, and no Servant is at a loſs for his Portion in due ſeaſon. How eaſie muſt this be to the People? ſcarcely percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and in a manner only a viciſſitude, or kind of exchange of Happineſs. Whereas the ſetting up of <hi>new Titles</hi> has <hi>inunmera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Inconveniencies,</hi> and cannot be effected (if at all) without great and laſting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions. 'Tis difficult to do, long a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and perhaps never well done; And in all theſe ſtages of its progreſs a Plague to the People This is ſo clear, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I am amazed, that any men, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Senſe and Judgment, ſhould be ſo fond of an <hi>Elective form of Kingſhip,</hi> or (what is much the ſame) <hi>altering the true</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:106284:113"/> 
                     <hi>legitmate Succeſſion.</hi> And now I have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, (and indeed I named it with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, as being moſt pertinent to my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) let me conjure you all, in the name of God, and as you tender your own and your Poſterities Welfare, that you never hearken to men who would inſtill ſuch Notions. God be bleſſed the <hi>Criſis</hi> is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and there's no danger, I think, at preſent, of any mens being about at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting matter of practice of this kind. But, I ſay, ſuffer no little State-menders to poſſeſs you or yours with any ſuch Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, or Notional imgagitations. Stick to <hi>Solomons</hi> Doctrine in my Text, of the happineſs of being governed by Kings the Sons of Nobles in an uninterrupted Line, and never hear of otherwiſe transferring Royalty.</p>
                  <p>And here give me leave in a few words, as the <hi>laſt Argument,</hi> to aſſert the Peoples Happineſs in being under Kings the Sons of Nobles, to ſhew you <hi>out of Scripture</hi> ſomething of <hi>the miſchief of Elective King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi> which too many in theſe Nations, of late years, have madly driven at. As long as I keep to Scripture, I may ſuppoſe my ſelf not much, if at all, out of my Kew.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt.</hi> In ſuch caſes, on every change,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106284:114"/> it cannot be comprehended or ſtated, how great the <hi>publick Sufferings</hi> or miſeries may may prove; but in the general it is moſt certain the people muſt ſuffer much, at leaſt, all mens Rights, Families and even perſons muſt be in perpetual turmoil and danger by reaſon of the <hi>uncertainty</hi> as well as <hi>variations</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> or of the particular <hi>methods</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> ſometimes it will not be known who is King: one party will contend one is, another will ſay theirs is; and however, the Power, that made one King to day, can unmake him to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and amongſt ſo changeable a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as they ſay we Iſlanders be, indeed as all mankind is, there can be expected no ſtability. Be pleaſed to ſee inſtances to this purpoſe out of holy Scripture. The People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who I am ſure were no Iſlanders, I mean <hi>the ten Tribes fell off</hi> from the Houſe or <hi>Line of David,</hi> which God had choſen and ſet over them, and they would chooſe for themſelves, and a very popular man they did chooſe, for their King; namely <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> xii. 20. After Wars, Diſorders and Deſolations, which laſted all his days, and during which, in <hi>one Battel</hi> there <hi>fell of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>His Son <hi>Nadab</hi> ſucceeds him indeed, or, as ſome think, reigned together with him towards the latter end of his days. However, before he was well warm in his Throne, <hi>Baaſha</hi> (a perſon of another Tribe, who had no pretence to the Crown, but who might quickly have as good a Title to it as either <hi>Jeroboam</hi> or <hi>Nadab</hi> had) <hi>conſpired againſt him and ſlew him,</hi> as would ſeem, in the head of his Army, <hi>and reigned in his ſtead,</hi> 1 King. xv. 27, 28. But how long will this new Title ſtand? After Wars again upon Wars, all his days, his Son <hi>Ela</hi> ſucceeds him: but <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two years</hi> Zimri <hi>Captain of half his Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots</hi>

                     <hi>conſpired againſt him, and ſlew him, as he was drinking himſelf drunk in the Houſe of</hi> Arza <hi>his Steward.</hi> Upon this <hi>Zim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> ſets up himſelf (chap. xvi. 9. 11.) and immediately <hi>ſlew all of</hi> Baaſha<hi>'s Houſe:</hi> (Here was a Recompence for <hi>Baaſha</hi>'s Treaſon.) But before <hi>Zimri</hi> had reigned over part of <hi>Iſrael</hi> full one week, another part of the people would have another King, and ſet up <hi>Omri:</hi> on which <hi>Zimri</hi> burns himſelf in his own Palace. And now (ver. 21.) <hi>Iſrael is divided,</hi> not only from <hi>Judah,</hi> as before, but within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: divided into two parts, ſaith the Text: <hi>For half of the People followed</hi> Tibni <hi>to make him King, and half</hi> Omri. To be ſhort, from the time the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> fell off from the Royal Line that God had ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, and betook themſelves to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chooſing, from that Revolt, I ſay, to <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> which was ſomewhat leſs than five and forty years, if rightly computed, they had ſix Kings indeed, but not one year of Peace: and of their ſix Kings, as far as I can find, only two died the death of other men; ſo frequent and ſo diſmal were the Alterations of Government! ſo unhappy the ſtate of things!</p>
                  <p>I will purſue the Hiſtory of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom no further, as to this particular of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106284:115"/> the uncertainty of Titles, and frequent Changes, which you ſee muſt needs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and when they happen, they rend Nations in pieces, and leave nothing ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, durable or ſecure; only out of what you have heard of the <hi>deplorable ſtate,</hi> into which this People brought themſelves, by <hi>breaking off the Succeſſion,</hi> and running into this kind of <hi>Elective Kingdom,</hi> I cannot but note to you,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>dreadful Cruelties and Bloudſhed,</hi> which commonly enſue on ſuch Elections, to eſtabliſh the New Prince. Thus as ſoon as <hi>Baaſha</hi> obtained the Throne <hi>he ſmote all the Houſe</hi> (that is, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Allies, and moſt likely all the Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>of Jeroboam;) he left not one of them that breathed until he had deſtroyed them,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> xv. 29. which, though it were <hi>Baa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi>'s Wickedneſs, and Gods juſt Judgment, executed on <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Family (however by a villanous Agent) yet in point of Policy and Security to himſelf, he was in a ſort neceſſitated to it; Now ſo great a Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter certainly could not but be a ſore pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Wound.

                     <hi>Reign (which was the ſeventh of</hi> Hezekiah <hi>King of</hi> Judah) <hi>the King and People of</hi> Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el <hi>were carried away Captives by</hi> Shalmane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer King of Aſſyria, <hi>and never returned again: for</hi> God removed <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of his ſight? <hi>'Tis ſo ſaid twice,</hi> 2 King. xvii. 18, 23. <hi>And 'tis obſervable, no one knows to this day whats become of theſe ten Tribes.</hi> But even during the whole ſtate or moſt ſettled time of their Kingdome, they had no face of true Religion, nor indeed any Religion conſtant amongſt them; but a <hi>Gallimafry</hi> of all the Gods and Idolatries of the Nations, according to the Honour or Intereſt of their Kings.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, the <hi>Kingdome of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> which continued under the <hi>Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Succeſſion</hi> and was <hi>Hereditary,</hi> ſtood near one hundred and forty years longer, than that of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and they had amongſt their Kings many great Saints, as <hi>Aſa, Jehoſophat, Hezekiah, Joſiah,</hi> and diverſe others. And though the Worſhip of God were often foully corrupted, in the Reign of ſome of their Kings, yet as that Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtill came in from the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or from Affinity or League with them, ſo by the Succeſſion of good Kings it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored again, and both the Church and Face of Religion kept up amongſt them;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106284:117"/> till it pleaſed God, for their treading in the ſteps of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to ſend his Church into Captivity, there to be cured of Idolatry. Which Cure when wrought (though there ſtill remained a general <hi>Cachexy</hi> or diſorder <hi>of Manners)</hi> yet it pleaſed God to bring back for a while their Captivity, and to give them a new footing in their own Land; till out of that <hi>Royal Stem</hi> was born our <hi>Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> the promiſed <hi>Seed of Abraham,</hi> the <hi>Son of David according to the Fleſh,</hi> but <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, by Power and Reſurrection from the dead, the Son of God, the Lord of Lords and King of Kings, bleſſed for evermore, of whoſe Kingdom there ſhall be no end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſum up all; If then there be any men, to whom <hi>perpetual unſettledneſs</hi> and <hi>dangers</hi> to <hi>themſelves</hi> and <hi>theirs,</hi> to whom <hi>continued ages of War,</hi> to whom ever and anon <hi>recurring Murder of Kings, Maſſacres of Families,</hi> together with all <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> over the people, and even <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Religion,</hi> as well as <hi>Government (<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation</hi> on <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man)</hi> be pleaſing, ſuch men may plead <hi>theſe Arguments</hi> to <hi>enamour the world</hi> with the <hi>model of Elective King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But on the contrary; If <hi>Publick Wealth, Eaſe and Quiet;</hi> I may add, if <hi>continued Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,</hi>

                     <hi>ſettled Religion,</hi> and <hi>general Stability</hi> (as far as the ſtate of ſublunary affairs does admit) be <hi>more amiable,</hi> we have reaſon to ſtick to a true <hi>Legitimate Succeſſion.</hi> For it was the Obſervation of the wiſeſt of Kings, <hi>Bleſſed art thou, O Land, when thy King is the Son of Nobles:</hi> and we ſee how far it proved ſo in the Kingdom of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have hitherto, as I think is moſt proper, and at leaſt on this day moſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, taken the words literally. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intimated another ſenſe of them, by which <hi>Son of Nobles</hi> came to denote <hi>perſons in themſelves truely Noble,</hi> that is, of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, brave and virtuous Souls: But this we have in part ſeen to be a frequent <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent</hi> of <hi>Lineal Nobility:</hi> and withal the <hi>ſecond member</hi> of the Text will lead us into its conſideration. For it follows, <hi>Bleſſed are thou, O Land, when thy Princes eat in ſeaſon, and not for Drunkenneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to Explication of this clauſe, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains only to be added to what has been aboveſaid of it, that the word <hi>Princes</hi> may be interpreted either,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of the <hi>Supreme,</hi> the <hi>King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of <hi>Subordinate Nobles</hi> or <hi>Governours:</hi> as we read uſually in the Scripture of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106284:118"/> 
                     <hi>Kings and their Princes,</hi> that is, <hi>Peers</hi> or <hi>Miniſters of State.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Perhaps it is the beſt way not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it ſingly or ſolely of either, but <hi>jointly of both.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And truly there is very good reaſon for this laſt Interpretation. For generally if the Prince Supreme, that is, the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be temperate and virtuous, the Princes ſubordinate will be ſo too; Temperance and Virtue will grow into faſhion at Court. And thus taken, this our ſecond part not only in <hi>general</hi> aſſerts, <hi>the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns Virtue to be the Peoples Bleſſedneſs,</hi> but gives us a main ſpecialty of that Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Virtue and good Manners will generally prevail in ſuch a Kingdome;</hi> than which there cannot be a greater good to a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>And this we will take as the <hi>firſt point of Advantage</hi> accruing to a People by their <hi>Kings being virtuous,</hi> His <hi>Example will take:</hi> It will have influence firſt on them that that are next him, the Nobles, Grandees or Favourites: It will from them diffuſe it ſelf through all Orders and Ranks of Men: for where ſhall not ſo powerful a Precedent be drawn into imitation. The very Defects and natural Blemiſhes of Kings have been affected: how much more
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106284:118"/> ſhall their Honours &amp; Excellencies be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied? This is matter of conſtant experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; <hi>Qualis Rex, talis Grex,</hi> the People will be like their King. If <hi>David</hi> be a <hi>war-like Prince,</hi> you ſhall hear of <hi>Davids Worthies:</hi> His Courtiers ſhall be <hi>Heroes</hi> as he is. If <hi>Solomon</hi> grow <hi>effeminate,</hi> the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhall all degenerate with him; Not a good Soldier in all his Reign, but what was left by his Father <hi>David.</hi> And ſo in caſe of other Qualities.</p>
                  <p>Now, without doubt, as there is no ſuch Plague to a Nation, as the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the publick Manners; ſo, I ſay, no greater Bleſſing, than the Melioration of them. The <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> ſay its Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, grew to its <hi>height</hi> by <hi>Temperance, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and Juſtice.</hi> When its <hi>Ceſars</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came wicked, and meer voluptuaries, it ſoon fell, <hi>[ſtantibus Moenibus, ruentibus Moribus]</hi> by the decay of its Manners, though its Walls ſtood. <hi>Bleſſed</hi> therefore <hi>art thou, O Land, when thy Princes eat in ſeaſon, for Strength, and not for Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>from this firſt Advantage</hi> will by plain natural cauſality <hi>ſlow a multitude of others,</hi> more indeed than is eaſie to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend or enumerate. What an <hi>Influence</hi> upon the <hi>Juſtice of the Nation</hi> muſt the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106284:119"/> Virtue of the Prince and Grandees have? For certainly the more virtuous they are, who adminiſter Juſtice, the more equal Juſtice will be adminiſtred. <hi>Virtue</hi> will be <hi>encouraged,</hi> conſulted and upheld, virtuous men preferred and exalted; <hi>Vice diſcountenanc'd</hi> and <hi>puniſht; ſerious Religion</hi> as well as <hi>civil Rights</hi> maintained, and all the honeſt <hi>Deſigns and Deſires of good men</hi> will generally <hi>ſucceed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, how muſt the ſame <hi>influence</hi> all <hi>publick Councils</hi> and <hi>Tranſactions?</hi> When the Prince and his Council are ever clear and mature, when they have ever both temper and time to think, are intent and watchful, ready to take all advantages for Good, and to foreſee publick Evils in their remote cauſes, while they yet want ſtrength to be miſchievous, what may not be hoped for? From hence it is plain, thoſe forementioned ſo popular Goods of <hi>Wealth, Eaſe, and Quiet</hi> are in the faireſt way to be <hi>provided</hi> for.</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially conſidering, laſtly, that ſo <hi>regular Lives</hi> and Manners of Prince, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and People conſpiring (as is ſuppoſed) in Temperance, and in general Virtue, muſt needs <hi>derive Gods Bleſſing</hi> both upon them <hi>all,</hi> and upon the <hi>whole Management and Adminiſtration</hi> of things. For God
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106284:119"/> will certainly verify the Word which he has publiſht, or, as I may ſay, his Faith which he has given, to the world; <hi>Say ye to the righteous, it ſhall be well with them, they ſhall eat the fruit of their doings.</hi> Iſai. iii. 10. <hi>And Righteouſneſs and Peace will aſſuredly meet and kiſs each other.</hi> Upon all accounts then we may pronounce, <hi>Bleſſed art thou, O Land, when thy Princes eat in due ſeaſon, for Strength, and not for Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To come now to <hi>Application,</hi> and to bring all we have ſaid to ſome ſerious, practical reſult.</p>
                  <p>If we reflect and conſider with our ſelves, we ſhall certainly find <hi>we are a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Land,</hi> and that in both the regards ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the Text. We cannot ſurely but be <hi>ſenſible</hi> of that <hi>profound Peace</hi> and <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Proſperity</hi> which God has vouchſafed us in this Kingdom under our preſent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign: Theſe are moſt obvious to every mans notice, and I may ſay, whether we will or no, we cannot but perceive them. But perhaps the immediate Combination, and happy Conſpiracy of <hi>Cauſes,</hi> which God makes uſe of to effect theſe, all of us do <hi>not conſider.</hi> Now I cannot tell whether any truer cauſes can be aſſigned hereof than theſe in my Text. We have <hi>a King</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:106284:120"/> both <hi>who is the Son of Nobles,</hi> and <hi>who eats in due ſeaſon, for Strength, and not for Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs.</hi> A Virtue! which will make not only Princes, but even common mens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs ſucceed well; and it were to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to many meaner men, for their own ſakes, that there were more of this in the world. For if Luxury has exhauſted the Treaſures of Kings and Kingdoms, it will much more eaſily and certainly conſume private Eſtates. But to return to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. Our Sovereigns not only Virtues, but Extraction, Title, and Intereſt (God be bleſſed) render him great and potent: and hereto, I ſay, namely, to his Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Title, to his Virtues and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, we do certainly under God, as much as to any thing, owe our preſent Quiet and flouriſhing Eſtate. <hi>Flouriſhing Eſtate</hi> I called it: for if will be true to our ſelves, there is nothing to make our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in general otherwiſe, except the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Fears, or poſſibly the Narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome of our own Hearts. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us ſeriouſly and from the ground of our hearts <hi>give God thanks</hi> for our <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent King,</hi> for his ſettling him in his Throne, for the Quiet and Eaſe which we enjoy thereby, and for his happy and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106284:120"/> Reign over us hitherto. Methinks no man amongſt us, who has his Senſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, ſhould be backward in this Office. I do not know that any is: However I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort that none be. I will plainly make the challenge to any: What Bleſſing could you deſire (at leaſt, which you can prove to be a publick Bleſſing) what Bleſſing, I ſay, could you deſire to enjoy, from or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any Prince, which is not at preſent indulged under our Gracious Sovereign. Have we not <hi>Property</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> and, if we will not break it our ſelves, <hi>ſacred</hi> as well as <hi>civil Peace?</hi> In a word, we are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtupid, or beſides our ſelves with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, if we are not ſenſible what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of Bleſſings we enjoy: and we are moſt vilely ungrateful, if being ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereof, we pay not our ardent and cordial Praiſe to God for His Majeſty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom we enjoy them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe true Gratitude lies not only in Words and Profeſſions, nor yet in ſome high-flown Ceremonies and Rodomon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tades amidſt our Jollities and Revels, let us be careful (what we have been often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to do) that both <hi>our ſelves</hi> and <hi>all under us</hi> maintain <hi>unſpotted Loyalty</hi> to our King: This will be real Thankfulneſs to him; and the contrary thereto (which I
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106284:121"/> hope we all abhor) would be the higheſt and moſt unnatural Ingratitude both to God and him. To be plain: I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as to the buſineſs of Rebellion, there is any fear we of theſe parts ſhall ever break out into it, or ſide with thoſe who do: I cannot be ſo unjuſt as ſo much as to ſurmiſe it: but give me leave to tell you, there are <hi>other Violations of Loyalty,</hi> beſides running out into open Arms or Warlike Hoſtility againſt our Kings, to which Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations the Manners and Humours of the late Age have rendred moſt of us, of the preſent Age, too much addicted. I will reckon up three of them, and I, in the name of God, as you would not approve your ſelves unthankful to God and the King, warn you all of them.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place I name <hi>unreaſonable fears:</hi> ſo unreaſonable indeed as to be groſly <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt;</hi> becauſe they are both againſt what His Majeſty has promiſed, and againſt what we yet find he does perform. Now ſhall we neither believe a King upon his Word, nor upon his Performances? What a miſerable condition are Princes in, if they of all men are the perſons, who on no terms may be credited or truſted? Let us in the name of God take heed of ſuch mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Diſloyalty. Akin hereunto are,</p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:106284:121"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thoſe <hi>abominable Miſconſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which too commonly the generality of men are apt to put upon particular acts of the Government. If a Prince take but a prudential courſe to ſecure his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there are many ſhall ſay, he makes preparation to deſtroy his People. Now what an unreaſonable thing is it to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any Prince ſhould wittingly ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to deſtroy his People? Does he not thereby, not only manifeſtly every minute hazard his own Life (for every minute may malice be working) but even directly deſtroy himſelf as a Prince. <hi>In the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of People is the Kings Honour: but in the want of People is the Deſtruction of the Prince,</hi> Prov. xiv. 28. to deſtroy therefore his People is, I ſay, to deſtroy himſelf. And certainly, if there be any Prince living, that by his Actions may ſeem to have been prodigal of his peoples Lives, of all the Princes in Chriſtendom our preſent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign never did (nor indeed any of this Line ever) give any reaſons to be ſuſpected hereof. Wherefore let us abhor alſo this degree of Diſloyalty. And the ſame let me ſay,</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, As to <hi>Miſreports,</hi> which are as frequent as Miſconſtructions, and but the effects of them; (for ſtill, <hi>Out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:106284:122"/> 
                     <hi>of the heart the mouth will ſpeak.)</hi> This is an Evil expreſly forbidden within two ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of my Text. <hi>Curſe not the King, no not in thy thought,</hi> ver. 20. <hi>Curſing</hi> in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Idiom uſually ſignifies only <hi>ſpeaking evil of:</hi> Now, ſo much as a <hi>thought</hi> hereto we may not advance; much leſs may we directly break that Command tranſumed from the Old Teſtament into the New, and ſtrictly exemplified by the great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles practice. <hi>Act.</hi> xxiii. <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſpeak evil of the Ruler of thy People,</hi> though (as in that caſe) a Jew, Infidel, or vileſt enemy to Chriſtianity. I pray you, let us all be tender of theſe three leſſer inſtances (as to ſome they may ſeem) of Diſloyalty, as knowing that they lead to greater, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to direct and the higheſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>To conclude the whole: Let us firſt of all <hi>keep cloſe each of us to God</hi> in a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diſcharge of our Duty to him, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him at all times, and pouring out our hearts before him eſpecially whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we are amuſed or afraid <hi>(Pſal.</hi> lvi. 3. <hi>What time I am afraid I will truſt in God.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us next <hi>maintain our Duty to our King,</hi> truſting him alſo, as under God our Safeguard and Defender, conceiving of, interpreting and reporting all his Actions
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106284:122"/> as fairly as we can, which is no more, than both in Loyalty, Juſtice and Charity we are bound to.</p>
                  <p>Let us, laſtly, be as <hi>helpful, ſweet and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging to one another,</hi> as we would have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be to our ſelves: In a word, let us be <hi>eaſie to our ſelves and others,</hi> and by this means as we are at preſent, ſo I doubt not but we may continue <hi>a bleſſed Land under Kings the Sons of Nobles and Princes, who eat for Strength, and not for Drunkenneſs.</hi> The continuance of which Mercy God grant to us through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

                  <p>THis <hi>Sermon</hi> being drawn up at firſt in haſte, I had once thought to have alter'd ſome ſmall Irregularities in its Method, which that haſte occaſioned.

                  <p>Firſt. That <hi>God alone Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally and Sovereignly</hi> has
<pb facs="tcp:106284:125"/> the Power of Humane Life and Death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. That <hi>the Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative or Delegated Power hereof in every Kingdom or Commonwealth is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from and under God in the ſupreme Magiſtrate alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly. That <hi>the ſupreme Magiſtrate exerciſeth this Power either in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of</hi> Civil Juſtice, <hi>or of</hi> Lawful War.</p>
                  <p>And from theſe three I would have deduced the other Points, <hi>viz. That no one, of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>

                  <p>TO the end we may more perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehend the true occaſion and full import of theſe words, it will be expedient to look back to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106284:128"/> forty ſeventh verſe, where we find our Lord betrayed into the hands of an armed Rabble, <hi>a great multitude with Swords and Staves,</hi> they are there called. After the Traytors Ceremonies and the Solemnities of the Treaſon were over, St. <hi>Peter</hi> (the beſt ſpirited, or moſt metall'd, perſon amongſt all our Lords Followers) ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his Maſters danger, <hi>having a Sword, drew it, and ſtrook a Servant of the High Prieſts, and cut off his Ear</hi> (ver. 51.) As to the <hi>hurt</hi> done to the perſon wounded, our Lord forthwith <hi>miraculouſly cured</hi> that: But as to Good St. <hi>Peters Officiouſneſs</hi> (for ſo it is to be named rather than Service) that <hi>received</hi> no other entertainment but <hi>check</hi> and <hi>chiding,</hi> and that in three verſes together; of which the Text is the firſt: <hi>Then Jeſus ſaid unto him, put up thy Sword into its place: for all they that take the Sword ſhall periſh by the Sword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which words need a little Explanation, at leaſt for <hi>reſtraining two phraſes,</hi> in them; elſe they will ſcarce be admitted as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally true. For neither can it be ſaid, that <hi>all, who</hi> in any ſenſe <hi>take the Sword,</hi> are thereby guilty of <hi>Sin;</hi> nor even that all who <hi>ſinfully take the Sword</hi> do, as to the <hi>event,</hi> actually <hi>periſh by the Sword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[As to the <hi>Check</hi> here given to St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:106284:128"/> 
                     <hi>Put up thy Sword into its place,</hi> I may ſuppoſe that plain enough: eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another Evangeliſt hath reported it, <hi>Put up thy Sword into its Sheath.</hi> That truly (I mean the Sheath) is the only due place of a Sword, when it is by <hi>Peters,</hi> or indeed by any Clergy-mans ſide. Let it, I ſay, be kept in the Scabbard, if a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man wear it: or rather let him not wear it at all; as mindful that his Coat is a more-legal Defenſative to him than his Weapon. <hi>Si Clericus Arma ferens ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beretur, non incidit in Canonem verberans. vid. Gloſſ. ad Cauſam</hi> 17. <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap. Quiſquis inventus fuerit.</hi> But this by the by.]</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Reaſon</hi> given <hi>of this Check</hi> is much more dubious. <hi>For they that take the Sword, &amp;c.</hi> and who are they that take the Sword in our Lords ſenſe, or in the way here reprehended? Some have anſwered, they who take it <hi>(ut interficiant)</hi> with an intent to kill: but that's too large. For both Magiſtrate and Civil Officers, as well as Military men, take it with this intent, yet without ſin. <hi>Gratians</hi> anſwer in the Canon Law is much better, and indeed very full and clear <hi>(Ille Gladium accipit, qui nullâ ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periori ac legitimâ Poteſtate jubente vel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedente in ſanguinem alicujus armatur.

The ſupreme Magiſtrate and thoſe commiſſionated by him <hi>receive</hi> or <hi>undertake the Sword;</hi> the Magiſtrate from God, who has committed it to him by putting him in the place he holds; the Civil Officer and Souldier from the Magiſtrate, who has commiſſionated both: But they <hi>take</hi> the Sword, who of their own raſh or headſtrong Will uſurp it to themſelves, be it on pretence ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>Now ſuch, ſaith our Saviour, <hi>ſhall periſh by the Sword.</hi> But is this true?

Or have not ſome (moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious &amp; principal ones, even in our own memory) dyed in their beds? they have ſo indeed; but our Lord reports here <hi>matter of Law,</hi> not <hi>of Hiſtory</hi> or <hi>Propheſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> take the Sword periſh by the Sword;</hi> but as to the <hi>Sentence of the Law</hi> and <hi>demerit of the Sin,</hi> there can be nothing of more conſtant
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106284:129"/> and perpetual truth, than that all ſuch are guilty of Murder, and incur the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or really forfeit Life. The <hi>Law</hi> in this caſe ſeems in a manner of the <hi>ſame date with mankind.</hi> For in the Old world, when <hi>Cain</hi> had murder'd his Brother <hi>Abel, It ſhall come to paſs, ſaith he, that every one that findeth me ſhall ſlay me.</hi> This Fear, or Expectation of his, could ariſe from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the demerit of his Sin, by reaſon of ſome <hi>Law,</hi> either <hi>innate</hi> or even then <hi>promulgate</hi> for the puniſhing Murder with death. But upon the reinſtating man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind upon earth, after the Floud, it was immediately <hi>in terminis</hi> or expreſly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> ix. 6. <hi>Whoſo ſheddeth mans Bloud, by Man ſhall his Bloud be ſhed.</hi> It is by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law reinforced; <hi>Life for Life,</hi> Exod. xxi. 23. And for ought I can ſee, the Execution under it was as quick as the Law; for amongſt the Jews, <hi>at Common Law,</hi> if I may ſo ſpeak in their State, the perſon or <hi>perſons next akin</hi> were the <hi>Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Bloud,</hi> and they <hi>ſlew the Murderer as ſoon as they could meet him;</hi> nor do I find any Tryal in caſe of Murder amongſt the Jews till the <hi>Cities of Refuge were ſet up,</hi> and even then, in caſe of manifeſt and plain Murder, the Tryal did not lie; but as before ſaid, <hi>the Avenger of Bloud was to</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106284:130"/> 
                     <hi>ſlay the Murderer as ſoon as he met him. Numb.</hi> xxxv. 15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus was the Law in this matter before our Lords time; and he in the Text rather gives it an Evangelical Sanction, than mitigates it. So that as to the merit of the Crime, by le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Sentence, there can be no Queſtion. And I may truly add, that there is no caſe wherein God more frequently takes the Forfeiture, or actually executes the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Law, in this world, than in the caſe of doing violence to the Lives of others. So far is this our Lords Speech true even as to <hi>the Event alſo,</hi> that perhaps not one Murderer in ten dies the death of other men.</p>
                  <p>The ſum then of what our Lord avows to back his Rebuke, or the Check he gave St. <hi>Peter</hi> is this;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That all thoſe who of their own accord, and without due Authority, attempt or take away the Life of another, are before God guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Murder, and deſerve the Puniſhment thereof, which is, to fall by the Hand of Juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the aſſerting hereof, I do not think it is poſſible, I will not ſay to urge, but even to deviſe any Evidence of ſuch advantageous circumſtances, as this in the Text: I will therefore preſs it more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:106284:130"/>
                  <p> It has ever generally been eſteemed <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to repel Force with Force.</hi> Now we ſee our <hi>Lord</hi> was here moſt <hi>forcibly ſeiſed,</hi> and that as was evident in order to ſuffer all the Violence and Cruelty, which Malice could exerciſe upon him: yet never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appeared ſuch <hi>Innocence and Holineſs</hi> in humane Nature, as from his very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and Cradle, had ſhone in him. Whether the <hi>Powers</hi> which commanded his Seiſure were <hi>juſt</hi> or no, we will not now examine; it is moſt ſure, <hi>their uſe</hi> of their <hi>Power</hi> againſt him was the <hi>unjuſteſt</hi> of any Inſtance aſſignable from the foundation of World. Further, St. <hi>Peter</hi> was one of our <hi>Lords Followers,</hi> and, if the Holy Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus had had an Houſe, <hi>Menials.</hi> Add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the <hi>Perſon</hi> in whoſe <hi>defence</hi> he drew was ſo <hi>extraordinary,</hi> that not only his Words, but even his Preſence might ſeem to warrant any act that was capable of being good, if done in his behalf. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>even himſelf</hi> and <hi>his Brethren</hi> were <hi>in danger</hi> from that Rabble, as well as his Maſter. What a multitude of concurrent circumſtances are there here to juſtifie St. <hi>Peters</hi> act? Eſpecially, I ſay, <hi>his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> the <hi>defence of his Brethren;</hi> nay, <hi>the defence of God himſelf in humane Nature,</hi> and all in <hi>a moſt juſt Cauſe,</hi> againſt <hi>Power</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:106284:131"/> 
                     <hi>more unjuſtly and more helliſhly uſed,</hi> than ever any Power was or could be on the face of the Earth; and both <hi>before</hi> and in the <hi>behalf of a perſon veſted with Power pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount to</hi> all under Heaven. Good God! can there be ever Caſe again like to this, ſo much, I ſay, as imagined? Yet for all this <hi>Peter</hi> is chid for his attempt; <hi>Put up thy Sword into its place: for they that take the Sword ſhall periſh with the Sword.</hi> No Cauſe then ſo juſt, which can warrant pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men to attempt the Life of others, without Authority from them, to whom God has entruſted the Power of the Sword.</p>
                  <p>For the further evidencing hereof I will lay down and make good the ſeven follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Concluſions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt. <hi>God alone originally and ſovereignly hath the power of humane Life and Death.</hi> Of the truth whereof there needs no other (as indeed there can no more ſolid) reaſon be given, than this, that <hi>he alone gave,</hi> or <hi>could give Life</hi> at firſt, and ſtill <hi>he alone preſerves</hi> and <hi>continues,</hi> or indeed can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it. <hi>Mille viae Mortis;</hi> there are a thouſand ways of extinguiſhing Life, but either the Gift of it or the Continuance of it is alone from God. We, poor mortals, are ſo far from being able to give Life to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106284:131"/> any thing, that we do not yet know what it is. That we live we know; what Life is we know not: but daily Experience in our Friends and ſelves teacheth us, the the very preſerving it in being, when gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, at leaſt to the term we would, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of Art, Induſtry, Strength or even that little Omnipotent (as it is too uſually looked upon) Money it ſelf. A minute of it cannot be purchaſed by all the Treaſures on or under Earth. <hi>Pſal.</hi> xlix. 8, 9. <hi>The Redemption of the Soul,</hi> that is, the prorogation of Life (as there the phraſe moſt certainly ſignifies) <hi>is precious, and it ceaſeth for ever: None can give to God a Ranſome for it, that he ſhould live for ever, and not ſee Death.</hi> Any and all the leaſt retrievals from it are of God alone, and proper to his Almighty Power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> lxviii. 20. <hi>He is the God of Salvation</hi> even in this kind, <hi>and to God the Lord belong the Iſſues from Death.</hi> Now ſeeing it was he alone, who when <hi>he had formed</hi> the Body of the firſt Man, <hi>breathed into him the Breath of Life, ſo that Man became a living Soul,</hi> ſeeing alſo it is he, whoſe <hi>Viſitation preſerveth mans Spirit,</hi> how can it in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Juſtice be conceived, that any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him ſhould have Sovereign Power of Life and Death? How ſhould any have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106284:132"/> right to take away, what neither they by themſelves, nor by any principal from whence they derive, could ever give? God therefore alone, I ſay, has original and ſovereign power of Life and Death.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>The derivative Power hereof in every Kingdom or Commonwealth is immediately in the ſupreme Magiſtrate alone;</hi> that is, God has in every ſuch publick Body commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Power to none immediately, but to thoſe whom therein he has made Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme.</p>
                  <p>By the <hi>Supreme Magiſtrate</hi> in every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I mean that Civil Power, whoſe acts are not under the Controll of another, ſo that they may be annull'd or <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Summa [Poteſtas Civilis] il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la dicitur, cujus actus alterius juri non ſubſunt, ita ut alterius voluntatis humanae arbitrio irriti poſſint reddi.</hi> Grot. de Jur.

Now ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſes to ſtyle <hi>Powers, Rom.</hi> xiii. 1, 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> iii. 1. And touching ſuch Power, or (which is the ſame, for he there uſes the terms <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> indifferently for one another) touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Ruler, he ſays expreſly, ver. 4. <hi>He is the Miniſter of God</hi> (Gods Agent or Vicegerent) <hi>a Revenger to execute wrath</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:106284:132"/> 
                     <hi>upon every one that doth evil.</hi> He is the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of God, to wit, <hi>He alone immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</hi> within his Territories, and <hi>no other</hi> but <hi>from, by or under him.</hi> Nor can there be a greater proof hereof than our Lords Practice here in the Text. Might any perſon, not being Supreme Magiſtrate, claim to himſelf a right to take the Sword, how is it poſſible that St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould have been reprehenſible in drawing his Sword, in the circumſtances he did, upon the mixed multitude of Jews and Romans ſent by the Authority of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> and <hi>Roman Prefect?</hi> If there had been any Power of this nature in any private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not derived from the Supreme Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, certainly he could not have wanted it in the preſent juncture. Yet you hear how ſolemnly and ſeverely our Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends him for the Attempt. And as neer as Chriſt was to his Death at the time of this Event in the Text, before he departed out of the world, he put another Seal to this truth. When <hi>Pilate</hi> after our Lords firſt Arraignment before him, and upon a ſtrict Examination, a little arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly thus expoſtulates with him, <hi>viz. Knoweſt thou not that I have power to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie thee, and have power to releaſe thee? Jeſus anſwered, thou couldeſt have no power</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:106284:133"/> 
                     <hi>over me, except it were given thee from above.</hi> John xix. 10, 11. In which words, if we conſider <hi>who Pilate was,</hi> namely, the <hi>Roman Governour</hi> ſent to them by <hi>Ceſar</hi> (the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme) we have a moſt plain Teſtimony, that however wicked Supreme Powers may be, or however wickedly they may uſe their Power, yet is their Power given them by God, and none may invade it, or take upon him to exerciſe it, but as they ſhall impart or delegate it. The Power of the Sword therefore, or of Life and Death, is by God committed only to the Supreme Magiſtrate, that is, as I preſume none here will ſcruple, within theſe Kingdoms to his Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. From hence it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that <hi>No one of himſelf can be Lord of his own Life.</hi> For he is no more to execute the power of the Sword upon himſelf, than upon another; becauſe he, as well as others, is a Subject. I know the <hi>contrary practice,</hi> namely diſpatching a mans ſelf out of life has been celebrated as an <hi>heroically virtuous act</hi> by divers <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and ſome great perſons amongſt them have been admired and commended for it extremely.</p>
                  <p>But of all Examples, Heathen mens are ſurely leaſt to be drawn into Rules, for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106284:133"/> the Authoriſing of doubtful Actions. [There is a Book alſo writ by a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctor of our Church, which is rather ſlandred than truly reported to maintain the <hi>Lawfulneſs of Self-ſlaughter.</hi> But thoſe who have read and underſtand that Book, know, the Authors deſign therein was but to move men to more charitable Judgment than uſually is put on ſuch, who lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands upon themſelves; and that he perſwades (amongſt others) by this great Argument; that the <hi>Act does not ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Repentance,</hi> but that 'tis poſſible the very <hi>Attrition,</hi> which ſome ſuch perſons may be thought to have <hi>(in articulo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis)</hi> in the very expiring, their Souls may be interpreted by God as a ſincere Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Now his ſuppoſing this act pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon Repentance, admits it to be a Sin; and then being by us known or even but ſtrongly conceived to be ſo, it will be damnable. For <hi>he that doubteth is damned, if he act, becauſe he acteth not of Faith. Rom.</hi> xiv. <hi>ult.]</hi> To be ſhort, the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we find of it in Scripture are only of wicked and deſperate men, and that when they have been rejected by God, forſaken by his Spirit, and an evil Spirit has ſeiſed them. Thus as to <hi>Saul,</hi> long before that deſperate act of falling on his own Sword;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106284:134"/> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxxi. 5.) <hi>The Spirit of God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him, and an evil Spirit from the Lord troubled him;</hi> chap. xvi. 14. that is, he was in a ſort permitted to the Devil to be actuated by him. So as to <hi>Judas, after the Sop Satan entred into him, (John</hi> xiii. 27) and then he quickly ſold and betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Maſter, and <hi>went and hanged himſelf. Laqueo Traditor periit. Laqueum talibus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliquit,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Auſtin (ad Petilianum.) The Traytor dyed by the Halter, and left the Halter only to ſuch as himſelf.</hi> The like deplorable and dreadful condition, as to his ſpiritual concerns at leaſt, may we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably conclude that Deviliſh Counſellor <hi>Achitophel</hi> to have been in, when being enraged that <hi>Abſolon</hi> would not take his helliſh Advice, he alſo went home and hanged himſelf. Beſides theſe three, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member no inſtance in Canonical Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture of any who directly ſlew themſelves. <hi>Sampſon</hi> indeed, as in caſe of other Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles done by him, ſo by immediate and extraordinary impulſe of the Spirit of God (that is, by Divine Warrantie and Command) pull'd down the Philiſtines great Hall of Judgment upon them and himſelf amongſt them: But this is only parallel to a great Soldiers going on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain death, to defeat the Enemy, when
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106284:134"/> duly commiſſioned ſo to do! and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt not come into account here. There is beſides in the <hi>Apocryphal Books</hi> an inſtance of one who acted moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous violence on himſelf; firſt falling on his own Sword, and then pulling out his very own Bowels, and throwing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Enemies, rather than he would fall into their hand to dye by them: and he is there commended for that inhumane act, which is ſtiled <hi>dying manfully.</hi> 2 <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cab.</hi> xiv. 42, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as that Book, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what the Author of it himſelf in the two laſt verſes confeſſes in effect, was not written by Divine Inſpiration, ſo were there nothing elſe in it to prove it Apocryphal, this alone that it commends what is ſo much <hi>againſt Nature</hi> both for the <hi>matter and manner</hi> of the Action were abundantly ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>But beſides, [it is moſt true, what was well ſaid in another caſe by an old Biſhop of <hi>Carliſle</hi> in <hi>Richard</hi> the Seconds time, <hi>We are not to live by examples, but by Laws.]</hi> The <hi>Law of God</hi> runs indefinitely, and ſo (becauſe there is no ground for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction as to this caſe) univerſally, <hi>thou ſhalt not murder;</hi> that is, neither another, nor thy ſelf. Which Interpretation muſt, indeed of neceſſity, be admitted here; for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106284:135"/> that our Lord himſelf makes the Love which we bear to our ſelves, to be the meaſure or ſtandard of the Love we owe to others. <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as thy ſelf.</hi> Which extending to <hi>all the Precepts of the ſecond Table,</hi> will as to <hi>this</hi> run thus; thou ſhalt no more mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy Neighbour than thy ſelf; that is, firſt of all thou ſhalt not murder thy ſelf. And though there be not in the Law of God any Precept more particular or more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly prohibitive as to this act, (as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there upon very grounds, againſt ſeveral other moſt unnatural Sins that might be named,) yet is there all Reaſon in the world againſt it. For, let us faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully examine, Is the Root whence this act proceeds ſuch from whence good Fruit may be expected? Is its true cauſe at any time good or truly praiſe-worthy? Was there ever perſon, yet who laid violent hands upon himſelf, who did it not either out of <hi>Pride, Cowardice, Raſhneſs,</hi> or <hi>mad Deſpair?</hi> Out of <hi>Pride,</hi> I ſay; becauſe either he would not crouch to his betters, or elſe ſee his equals become his ſuperiors: or out of <hi>Cowardice,</hi> as afraid to ſuffer what his Enemies might put him to; (now in both theſe caſes, is it not more brave to dare to live? or out of <hi>Raſhneſs</hi> and <hi>Madneſs,</hi> or <hi>Deſpair;</hi> as impatient of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106284:135"/> evils, and hoping in this Life no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtate. And if out of any of theſe, is it at all commendable? True Philoſophy it ſelf taught better, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad, <hi>Injuſſu Imperatoris, id eſt</hi>

                        </note> affirm, this we by all poſſible ways avow, that no one may bring voluntary death upon himſelf, to eſcape thereby a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny temporal pains, leaſt he fall into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106284:136"/> ones: No one may do it by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of anothers ſins, leſt he thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to have moſt grievous ſin of his own; nor becauſe of any of his own paſt ſins, for the curing of which by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, he has more need to continue in life. Nor through deſire of a better life, which may be hoped for after death; becauſe a better Life after Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to him who is guilty of his own Death.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This then is our third Concluſion; No one is Lord ſo much as of his own Life.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly. <hi>Whoſoever</hi> therefore <hi>pretends or exerciſes a Power over other mens Lives, muſt either derive that Power from the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magiſtrate to whoſe Dominions he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, or in caſe he do not, he becomes by ſuch Exerciſe or Attempts, either an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, or Murderer, or both.</hi> If he pretend to a <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Power</hi> herein, not deriving it as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, he is an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper,</hi> and that, as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally it comes to paſs in all Uſurpers, is as much as a <hi>publick Murderer.</hi> If he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe only a <hi>private Power,</hi> as ſuppoſe in righting or avenging himſelf or any third perſon againſt ſome ſingle injurious man, he hereby becomes a <hi>private Murderer:</hi> at leaſt before God, in caſe the Life of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or of any other, be but hazarded by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106284:137"/> his Act. This is moſt plain: for having no ſuch Power in himſelf, and it being by God committed only to the Magiſtrate, he can never come by it regularly and in Gods way, except he receive it from them, to whom God has committed it. Thus, though the whole remains of <hi>Sauls</hi> Houſe were in open Hoſtility againſt <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> particularly ſo keen an Enemy to <hi>Davids</hi> perſon <hi>that he ſought his Life,</hi> yet when <hi>Baanah</hi> and <hi>Rechab</hi> under pretence to do <hi>David</hi> a Service, and <hi>avenge their Lord the King of</hi> Saul <hi>and his Seed,</hi> go in privately to <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi>'s Houſe, and take off his Head to bring it as a preſent to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, David</hi> pronounces Sentence againſt them both as Murderers; becauſe though there were a publick Quarrel, yet theſe two officious wretches, having no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to act or interpoſe therein, could not derive any Right or Authority for what they did either from God or Man. 2 <hi>Sam</hi> iv. 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Admit <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Death, yet theſe men had no right to inflict it on him. Thus as to our fourth Concluſion.</p>
                  <p>The fifth is, <hi>The Magiſtrate exerciſeth this Power of the Sword, either in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Civil Juſtice, or of lawful War.</hi> A third way, I think, cannot be aſſigned:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106284:137"/> and therefore, as we will more fully touch by and by, whoſoever pretend to have received Power of Life and Death from the Magiſtrate but are neither Civil Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, or legitimately enrolled in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Liſt, are ſtill by ſuch pretence no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Murderers.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, as to matter of <hi>Civil Juſtice:</hi> the perſons uſually commiſſioned herein, are either thoſe who diſpence the Laws, as <hi>Judges, Juſtices,</hi> and the like; or thoſe who execute them, as <hi>Sheriffs</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-Officers.</hi> That both theſe ſorts of men muſt derive their Power from the <hi>King as Supreme,</hi> or elſe cannot act warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, I think none will queſtion. We have precedents enough in the Jewiſh Kingdom. In <hi>Davids</hi> time, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> viii. 15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But more explicitly afterwards: 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xix. 5, 6. to the end; <hi>Jehoſophat</hi> there ſet Judges in the Land, ſome <hi>fixed,</hi> as it would ſeem, <hi>through all the fenced Cities of</hi> Judah <hi>City by City:</hi> others <hi>itiner ant,</hi> who went out and <hi>returned to Jeruſalem.</hi> ver. 8. And the Subordination of Officers to the ordinary Judges, as well as of the Judges to the Supreme Powers, we have account of, not only in the Old Teſtament, but even from our Lord himſelf in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels. <hi>Matth.</hi> v. 25. <hi>Luk.</hi> xii. 58. Here
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106284:138"/> is the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Magiſtrate (we render it) or Prince, that is he <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Grot. in loc.</note> who <hi>has Power to appoint the Judge:</hi> The <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or Judge, who is to determine Controverſies <hi>between Bloud and Bloud, according to Law and Commandment, Statutes and Judgments.</hi> And laſtly here is the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Exactor, as the word ſignifies, whoſe buſineſs it was to put or ſee put the Sentence in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee how this Civil Power of the Sword was legally and orderly deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, diffuſed and managed amongſt the Jews. And the ſame God of Order ſtill governs the world, and both does, and ever will delight in Order.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. When Civil Juſtice cannot take place, the Magiſtrate exerciſes the Power of the Sword in <hi>lawful War.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Offenders are too numerous for civil Puniſhments, and ſtand in juſtification of their Crimes againſt the Powers which God has ordained. Sometimes not ſo much a few private perſons, as whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, at leaſt thoſe who manage Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal concerns, may be injurious to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring People: And in ſuch caſe Juſtice cannot be done without War. Now here alſo the Magiſtrate <hi>bears not the Sword in</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:106284:138"/> 
                     <hi>vain:</hi> but he is to raiſe what armed Force he ſees fit, for the righting or defending himſelf or people. And his people are to be obedient to him, to ſtand by him with Lives and Eſtates, and to ſerve him in the War; And whomſoever he <hi>Commiſſions,</hi> not only <hi>may, according to the tenor of their Commiſſion</hi> (which by the way they are to take care they do not exceed) but <hi>ought, to uſe the Sword;</hi> for ſuppoſing the War lawful, the Duty of the Subject in this caſe follows by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
                  <p>Now you'l ſay, when is a War law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When there is ſuch <hi>neceſſity</hi> of it as before ſuggeſted; that is, when <hi>Publick Juſtice or Right cannot take place without it;</hi> and when the <hi>Benefit,</hi> which is ſought by it, is ample enough to <hi>countervail all the viſible miſchiefs</hi> of the War. In which caſe the <hi>Supreme Power</hi> is <hi>Judge;</hi> not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who cannot be ſuppoſed competently to underſtand the publick ſtate of things and circumſtances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the War is <hi>made by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that has Power</hi> to make it; namely, by the Supreme in every Nation. For we have heard, though the Cauſe be juſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one may not of his own head take
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106284:139"/> the Sword, but a lawful Commiſſion is to be expected.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the general, it is requiſite alſo to a lawful War, that it be <hi>publickly proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> that is, Juſtice ſhould be demanded, the obſtinate ſummoned to their Duty, and no proceeding till ſuch Duty or Juſtice be refuſed. Somewhat very near this God expreſly commanded the people of the Jews, <hi>Deuteronom.</hi> xx. 10, 11, <hi>&amp;c. When thou comeſt to a City to fight againſt it, thou ſhalt proclaim Peace to it—And if it will make no Peace with thee, but will make War againſt thee, thou ſhalt beſiege it, &amp;c.</hi> But if Juſtice may be had with Peace, Peace certainly is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly. Even War it ſelf ſhould be <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged lawfully;</hi> and <hi>Juſtice, Redreſs, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction only ſought,</hi> not Revenge. Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould be as much forborn, and Mercy as much exerciſed as publick Safety would admit. Theſe things will be further uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to us by and by. In the mean while let this ſtand as our fifth Concluſion. The Magiſtrate exerciſes the Power of the Sword either in Civil Juſtice or lawful War.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly. <hi>All deſigned taking away the Life of man, otherwiſe than in a way of Civil</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:106284:139"/> 
                     <hi>Juſtice or lawful War</hi> (and that alſo, unleſs by ſuch only as are reſpectively commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the Magiſtrate) <hi>is Murder;</hi> yea the very <hi>Attempt of it Murder in the Eye of God.</hi> For, out of theſe two caſes, no man can have any thing to do lawfully with the Sword.</p>
                  <p>You'l ſay, What ſhould a man do in caſe of his own <hi>ntceſſary Defence?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>I may not directly and ordinarily deſign to take away anothers Life in my own defence.</hi> It may ſo come to paſs that I may be ſo unhappy as to be neceſſitated to do that, from whence it may enſue: but, if I be guiltleſs of Bloud therein, my killing the man was <hi>indirectly, by accident and conſequent,</hi> not by <hi>deſign.</hi> The thing I deſigned, or ought to have deſigned, was only <hi>diſabling him,</hi> and thereby <hi>ſecuring my ſelf:</hi> the killing the man in this behalf falls out beyond my intention, in caſe I am innocent. And even this, the utter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling a man to hurt me, ought not <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily,</hi> I ſay, to be done: for <hi>ordinarily</hi> a man may defend himſelf, if he will be prudent, and uſe all advantages he has, without hazarding his own or his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Life, and perhaps without mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting eithers perſon.</p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:106284:140"/>
                  <p> But it will be ſaid, This caſe of <hi>Self-Defence</hi> comes <hi>neither</hi> under <hi>Civil Juſtice</hi> nor <hi>Lawful War.</hi> I anſwer therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis <hi>mixt</hi> of both. In caſe I am ſet upon by Robbers, or by like unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, who attempt my Life, beſides that <hi>the Law of Nature</hi> gives me a <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> to <hi>defend my ſelf</hi> againſt <hi>lawleſs Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> every <hi>honeſt peaceable Subject</hi> may in ſuch circumſtances where other Officers cannot be had, be ſuppoſed by an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit or virtual Conceſſion or Commiſſion of the Magiſtrate, to be an <hi>Officer</hi> to bring ſuch miſcreants to Juſtice; which bringing them to Juſtice, next to our own Defence, ſhould be a principal part of every mans deſign in repelling Violence by Violence.</p>
                  <p>Again, it is fairly enough reducible to <hi>lawful War.</hi> For I am ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the preſent caſe <note place="margin">In reos Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatis &amp; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licos hoſtes om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis homo miles eſt. Tertullian. Apolog.</note> aſſaulted with Weapons of War; and the Prince has not opportunity to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Civil Officers or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men to my Relief and Protection. I cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but interpret I have his <hi>Leave to fight in Defence</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>my ſelf,</hi> againſt the <hi>Enemies of the Prince,</hi> of his Laws, and Government; for ſuch all Robbers and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106284:140"/> Hectors are. If there were in the caſe any oppoſing of thoſe who were ſent by the Magiſtrate, though by abuſe of his Power, as it was in St. <hi>Peters</hi> caſe in the Text, I could pretend to no right in my own Defence, but I muſt ſubmit.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, if I my ſelf begun the Quarrel, and were the firſt aſſailant: for in both theſe caſes I were injurious to the Magiſtrate and could not reaſonably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret any ſuch Favour from him belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me. But being thus illegally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, I have Juſtice, the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and of my Prince upon my ſide: I act under and not againſt the Equity of this ſixth Concluſion.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly and laſtly. It being evident by what has been aboveſaid, that the Military as well as Civil Sword belongs only to the Supreme Magiſtrate; therefore <hi>the levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or waging War without or againſt his Commiſſion is</hi> (by the Text) <hi>Murder,</hi> and perhaps upon other grounds <hi>more.</hi> It is certainly ſuch a taking the Sword, as deſerves periſhing by the Sword. To ſpeak the ſame thing in terms more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate to our Government: For any perſon or perſons to levy or make War within theſe Kingdoms without the Kings Commiſſion or againſt thoſe who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106284:141"/> by him, is, I ſay, and ever has been, by the Evangelical Law in the Text, Murder: and certainly, by right Reaſon as well as by other Law, ſomewhat more than Murder, namely, <hi>Rebellion and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> It is indeed the moſt dreadful and complicate Murder imaginable. It is firſt direct and plain Murder of all who fall by our hands. It is further Murder of our ſelves; of our Souls by Sin, of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by expoſing our own Lives. Laſtly, it is Murder of all we draw in with us, and that, as of our ſelves, both as to Soul and Body, without Gods great Mercy. But it is, beſides all theſe, moſt proper and plain Rebellion; for it is a plain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the Kings Right, and in part, or ſo far forth, a dethroning him; and there's no doubt, but if it ſucceed, it ends in total dethroning and murdering him too. After all which ſaid, I may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge both our old and later, our open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced and our demure Rebels to make bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it if they can.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, the <hi>ſum</hi> is, the Kings Majeſty is amongſt us the Fountain of all Power Civil and Military. Without a Commiſſion from him, expreſs or virtual, as before determined, none may either privately or publickly take the Sword;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106284:141"/> or if they do, by the Law of God, though they act never ſo privately, they ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by the Sword, they have run into the Guilt, and incur'd the Puniſhment of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers.</p>
                  <p>Now by way of Application</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for our own <hi>Direction in the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling our Souls before God</hi> for our Sins: We may ſee by what has been ſaid the <hi>ture Nature,</hi> and learn the <hi>true Names</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe <hi>our Sins,</hi> in the view of ſtyle of which poſſibly we have been too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable. All the <hi>raſh Attempts</hi> we have made on our own or others Life, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have eſcaped the Sentence of human Laws, are by the Law of God no leſs than Murder: <hi>He that taketh the Sword ſhall periſh by the Sword;</hi> that is, as we have heard, deſerves it as a Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. All thoſe <hi>Duels</hi> and <hi>Rencounters,</hi> which our Wine, Paſſions, or other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, nay which the Importunity of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates, which falſe-named Friendſhip and vain Honour, have at any time engaged us in, however we have come off, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſo many acts of Murder, and we our ſelves, <hi>(toties quoties)</hi> Murderers. To which private Sins of our own, if we
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106284:142"/> add thoſe direct and actual Murders which are and have been committed in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not only in Duels (a barbarous Cuſtome yet in all ages, eſpecially theſe later moſt impiouſly frequent) but <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres</hi> and <hi>Rebellions</hi> (not to ſpeak of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more private methods of Murders on occaſion of <hi>Robberies</hi> and by <hi>malicious lying in wait, Poiſon, Trechery, falſe Accuſations,</hi> and ſome like ways of <hi>killing men, under pretence of Juſtice;)</hi> if, I ſay, we add all theſe together, good God! under what a weight of Bloudguiltineſs does this Nation lye! And what need have, even the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, to be in daily Prayers to God, that ſome overflowing Scourge ſweep not them away with the guilty! But much more then, what need have all that have been guilty, (and particularly, if any of them, who had their hands in the work of this time was four and forty years, do yet ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, what need have they) to be not only in Prayers but Tears night and day, if ſo be their unchriſtian taking, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane uſing of the Sword, may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given unto them. Sure it is, whatſoever ſome men may flatter themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Sins of ſo deep a dy will never be forgiven without profound Repentance.</p>
                  <p>I have heard there are many perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106284:142"/> in this Kingdom at preſent, who utterly <hi>deny</hi> there was any <hi>Rebellion of the Iriſh</hi> at the time we aſſign it: nay, I have read ſome of their Papers giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thoſe Commotions, as they would be content to have them termed, that ſtyle them <hi>[Juſtiſſimum ſanctimúmque Bellum pro Fide.] A moſt juſt and holy War for the Faith.</hi> I could wiſh from my heart that all the Cruelties which were then, or have been ſince acted, were utterly forgot, and I beſeech God forgive them, as far as any of the Actors or the Abettors of them are yet in a ſtate remiſſible. But I cannot conſent to, nor endure to let paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlled ſuch miſcalling of things, leſt men, ſuppoſing the things to anſwer the names, carry all away, in a courſe of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceit and flattery, to their own and others deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt</hi> then, admitting, but not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that All That was the true Chriſtian Faith, which the Natives generally then profeſſed, Did they not then enjoy it, and had they not more Liberty of it before they broke out into Arms than ever ſince? This was not then the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why they took the Sword. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, admit this were the Reaſon, can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtian man, who conſiders what
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106284:143"/> he ſays, maintain this Doctrine; That Subjects of their own heads may take up Arms, to obtain what Form of Religion they pleaſe for their Country; that is for them, who like not that Form of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as for them who like it? This is not only unchriſtian, but moſt unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to affirm. But,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Was not the Sword taken, not only <hi>without,</hi> but <hi>againſt the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> againſt thoſe who were actually in Power, repreſenting him, and commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionated by him? It was, I confeſs, a Calumny caſt upon that glorious King and Martyr, <hi>Charles the Firſt,</hi> that one of the Chieftains of the Rebels had produced His Majeſties Commiſſion for taking Arms; and indeed the perſon we mean did at firſt pretend ſo much. But I owe ſuch Juſtice as well as Veneration to the Memory of that bleſſed Prince, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear openly to avow, I my ſelf know the men yet living, who can atteſt they heard that very perſon, before his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xecution, confeſs, the Royal Seal was taken off from an Inſtrument of another nature, (Letters Patents as I remember for ſome Lands) and cunningly affixed to that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Commiſſion, His Majeſty having been never in the leaſt acquainted with any of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106284:143"/> their deſigns. For theſe two reaſons then it could be no lawful War: The Aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors had neither <hi>lawful Cauſe</hi> nor <hi>lawful Authority;</hi> their Deſign, I ſay, being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and againſt the Royal Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let me demand, Was it a War <hi>lawfully proclaimed?</hi> Or was it not moſt induſtriouſly and marvellouſly concealed, not diſcovered but in one place, and that but a few hours (comparatively) before it broke out? Inſtead of thinking of any Hoſtility, were not the poor <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that ſuffered, ſecure in the Friendſhip and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity of their Neighbours, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares, unarmed, without any Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they were ſet upon, and—I will not ſay how handled. Is this either a Juſt or Honourable way of making War?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly.</hi> Was it managed in a <hi>lawful and Chriſtian ſort?</hi> Were the Qualities and Condition of the perſons, who fell in the firſt five months, ſuch as conſtituted them fit Objects for the Sword of a juſt War? Or were the kinds of Death, by which they dyed, becoming Chriſtians to inflict? Or was the number of the ſlain proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to any damages could be pretended
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106284:144"/> to have been ſuſtained by the aſſailants, even according to the Rules of the moſt rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Juſtice? [One hundred and fifty four thouſand Proteſtants, Men, Women and Children maſſacred between the Three and twentieth of <hi>October</hi> and the Firſt of <hi>March</hi> following, by computation of the Prieſts themſelves that were preſent, and were directed by the Principals engaged, to take a juſt computation; beſides all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when they left off to compute, and the multitudes that fell in the War enſuing.] I will not ſpeak ſo particularly as I could to all theſe Points; becauſe my deſign is only to move to Repentance, not to refreſh the memory of the injured: But in a word, here is not any one of thoſe points, which conſtitute a War juſt, to be found in this dreadful Inſurrection and Maſſacre. Wherefore as to thoſe, who are ſo impenitent and remorſleſs as not to allow it to have been, what it has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>a Rebellion;</hi> I will only deſire of them, becauſe they pretend to be the greateſt if not only Kings-men, not to contradict two of their and our moſt gracious Kings. And here not to ſpeak of ſeveral Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and Statutes made by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of ever bleſſed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106284:144"/> memory, in which this War, as theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen would ſtyle it, is expreſly called a Rebellion, (with ſome aggravating Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets) and its Authors Rebels (not to ſpeak I ſay of theſe, becauſe ſome may ſay a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick Parliament pen'd them) what will they ſay of that (now bleſſed) Kings dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Penitentials? Did he in them utter any thing, but the ſincere conceptions of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Soul? Let then any one peruſe Chap. 12. of his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and ſee if he ſpeaks not there in the expreſs terms we uſe. Nay, let any one look upon the Statute for the obſerving of this Day made in the Reign of our late gracious Sovereign <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, which according to Order was even now read, ſee what terms are uſed there. (Now this being the Kings Law, muſt be taken to be the Kings Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.) See in the name of God; not to call <hi>one another</hi> names, but to give <hi>our Sins</hi> the true names in our Confeſſions and Penitentials for them before God. But I have dwelt long enough on this; I will only add, that I am my ſelf far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and would have others far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation are peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſuch an Humour, as thoſe whoſe Cruelty we give God thanks we were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106284:145"/> from; or as thoſe others, who will not allow this Days-work to have been Cruelty and Rebellion. There are undoubtedly a multitude of them harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs people, and many others generous; good-natured, loyal, and brave-ſpirited perſons. And if after all there be any of a contrary ſtrain, whom what hath been ſaid will not convince of their Sin, I only pray the Lord have mercy on them.—To proceed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. From the whole Tenour of this Diſcourſe appears, <hi>the utter unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Subjects reſiſting the Prince or Magiſtrate,</hi> whom God has ſet over them; yea, though it be in the Abuſe of his Power. If in ſuch caſe our Lord Jeſus had reſiſted, Mankind had never been Redeemed. Yet had it been moſt eaſie for him, had it been conſiſtent with the Laws, which he was to enact, to have baffled all the Violence, with which he was, or could be aſſaulted. For though he had but twelve Apoſtles even at firſt, and of them only one that dared to fight for him, yet <hi>could not I,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have asked of my Father, and he would have given me more than twelve Legions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?</hi> But this would neither have ſtood
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106284:145"/> with his Sufferings, nor with the other Ends of his coming, the Doctrine and Example of moſt holy Life, which he was to leave unto the World. And therefore, as, in the <hi>Text,</hi> he moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly <hi>delivers</hi> the <hi>Doctrine of Non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance (Put up thy Sword into its Sheath;)</hi> ſo in the whole <hi>Context</hi> he <hi>practiſeth it:</hi> Wherefore none can eſteem themſelves Followers, either of Chriſts Doctrine, or Example, that is, <hi>none</hi> can eſteem themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who ſhall in the hardeſt circumſtances they can be put; <hi>reſiſt their Prince</hi> or <hi>thoſe that are ſent by him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Upon conſideration of what has been ſaid, let us be moved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to <hi>put a due value</hi> both <hi>upon our own and others Lives:</hi> Let us not, at leaſt, ſo vainly and trivially expoſe them, as in every mad and raſh fit we are apt to do. I will not ſpeak at preſent of thoſe <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold indirect ways of Murder,</hi> that are in the world: When men do any unlawful or unwarrantable act to themſelves or others, by which, though not intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, the untimely End of either enſue (as drinking themſelves or others into mortal Fevours, Frenz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106284:146"/> like acts, this is Murther before God, though indirect indeed, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by conſequence, yet really and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch. My <hi>Text</hi> confines me more to the <hi>Sword-work.</hi> And give me leave here a little to inſiſt expreſly againſt that abominable and moſt unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but frequent practice of <hi>Duel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> I beſeech and conjure all men to conſider, neither the Old <hi>Law of God</hi> nor the <hi>Goſpel</hi> make any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Murder,</hi> and what our Common Law calls <hi>Man-ſlaughter.</hi> To attempt or deſign taking away the Life of any, though in never ſo violent and tranſient a Paſſion, is by Gods Law and by the Goſpel, Murder. And <hi>no Murderer ſhall enter into the Kingdome of Heaven;</hi> that is, moſt ſurely none, who dyes impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently ſuch. Now 'tis ſeldome or never that any man dyes in a Duel, but there dyes one ſingly or doubly a Murderer and impenitent. For, though murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he dyes a Murderer, at leaſt of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe he had no right to take the Sword; and, according as before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, by his taking it unwarrantably, has brought his own Death upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:106284:146"/>
                  <p> Further, 'tis of all Duelliſts general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſure enough, neither but would have ſped the other; the perſon ſlain would as truly have ſped his Adverſary, as his Adverſary has ſped him, could he have done it. Wherefore in Will and Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he that falls is a Murderer of the Surviver, that is, doubly a Murderer; and in both caſes too commonly impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, as dying before he comes to Temper ſedate enough for Repentance. So that, I ſay, for the moſt part, ſuch perſons die doubly Murderers, and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; and then, Good God! what is their eſtate! Conſider this in the name of God, all ye that are ſo wickedly prodigal of your own and others both Bloud and Souls. On what Trifles and ridiculous Puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>io's do you generally venture both? For when was there almoſt any private <hi>Duel</hi> heard of, the <hi>Occaſion</hi> whereof was ſuch a <hi>wrong,</hi> as the <hi>Law aſſigns a man Satisfaction</hi> for? This is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reſolution in theſe caſes<hi>—I can have no Satisfaction by Law, therefore I'll fight him.</hi> Now let us but attend how <hi>unreaſonable this Reſolution is:</hi> It a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts plainly to thus much, the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front or (pretended) Injury I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106284:147"/> is ſo ſmall, that the Law takes no notice of it: therefore I'll exact the greateſt Satisfaction by or againſt any Law, in any other caſe, imaginable; for greater cannot be given by Man than the mans own Life. [Nay perhaps, what I deſign, as a Satisfaction, may be the <hi>greateſt wrong to my ſelf,</hi> the loſs of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul, I may dye by it in my Sin. Now is this reaſonable, ſuch an one has done me <hi>a ſmall wrong,</hi> (perhaps none, perhaps has only <hi>croſs'd</hi> me in my <hi>humour,</hi> poſſibly too only in my <hi>Vices;)</hi> but admit he has done me a ſmall wrong, what then? Why, then I will <hi>compel him to do me a greater,</hi> namely, to kill me in his own defence. Nay, therefore will <hi>I do my ſelf the greateſt,</hi> I will venture both Body and Soul in a moſt unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and unreaſonable Revenge. For being in this caſe, I take the Sword of my own raſh will, without any Warrant from God or Man, nay againſt the Laws of both, may I not expect actually to periſh by the Sword? And becauſe I preſumptuouſly, and <hi>with an high hand,</hi> ruſh on ſuch vile Sins, to <hi>dye impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently</hi> too, and forſaken by Gods Grace; which if I do, how eternally deplorable,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106284:147"/> but utterly irremediable, is my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?] Oh! that men would but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe things, and value their own Lives, only as God has valued them! At leaſt, that they would but keep thoſe Laws, which he has made to preſerve and ſecure them! If but this could be obtained, not one in an hundred of thoſe who do, would dye untimely or unnatural Deaths.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly. In caſe for our Sins God ſhould ſo puniſh this Nation, that we ſhould live to ſee the <hi>Sword of War drawn again,</hi> let us remember we have been this day taught <hi>our Duty in ſuch times.</hi> Let us all, that are <hi>able</hi> or <hi>qualified,</hi> to <hi>take the Sword, take it at his Hands,</hi> and in <hi>his Defence, who has received the Sword from God;</hi> our <hi>King's</hi> I mean. Let us all ſtick <hi>to the Crown,</hi> in <hi>its true and legal Deſcent.</hi> This is the <hi>only way</hi> to keep <hi>good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> and the <hi>likelieſt way</hi> to ſecure or retrieve <hi>Peace.</hi> For if Pretenders find few or no Abetters, if the great Body of the Nation take the ſide, which all good men will take; namely, as ſaid, that of the Royal Authority, all <hi>Civil Wars</hi> muſt <hi>quickly be at an and;</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> I think and hope, we need not <hi>fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:106284:148"/>
                  <p> But God keep far from us all Attempts of any War. And I know no better Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative from any, than that all would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what our Saviour in teaching St. <hi>Peter</hi> here, has taught us all, <hi>They that take the Sword, ſhall periſh by the Sword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The good Lord give Peace in our days, and to the God of Peace be all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
